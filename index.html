<p class="calibre1">Welcome to Shadowrun, Sixth World! 2019 is the thirtieth anniversary of Shadowrun, and what better way to celebrate than with a new edition of one of the most enduring role-playing games of all time? Shadowrun endures because it takes everything cool about genre role-playing and throws it in your face. Wanna face scheming villains? Fierce monsters? Fire-breathing dragons? They’re all out there, but the villains throw fireballs with one hand and shoot exploding ammo with the other, the monsters guard a top-secret corporate research compound, and the dragon? She owns the com- pound. The chance to face all these dangers and try to survive the dystopian Sixth World is what shadowrunning is all about. A new edition is an opportunity for both refine- ment and experimentation. So what did we bring to this version? The core goals are simple: put the classic man, magic, and machine elements of Shad- owrun in a more streamlined package, making the rules move faster while still giving players lots of</p>
<p class="calibre1">choices and tactics. This Shadowrun book is short- er than the past few editions, but it still has space for plenty of options. Shadowrun: Anarchy exists for players who want a fast-moving, more narra- tive game, and it will continue to be supported. So Shadowrun, Sixth World fills the space that is more detailed. You’ll roll the dice more often in this edition than in Anarchy and have more op- tions to push the odds in your favor. There are also more choices of all kinds&mdash;gear, spells, augmenta- tions, etc. We hope players will find lots to do and will be able to get to do it quickly! The way we figure it, there will be two kinds of people reading this book: people who have played Shadowrun before, and people who hav- en’t. We think that covers everyone. New players might want to check out the opening short story, “Four Square,” followed by The Life You Have Left, which provides an overview of the setting, its history, and most importantly, the role play- ers will fill in it. The Game Concepts chapter then provides the critical information you need</p>
<p class="calibre1">// INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">to play the game. There is valuable stuff in every chapter, of course, but those ones will give you a grounding in what the game and the world it’s 8 set in are about. Veteran players might just want to skip to the Game Concepts chapter to see some of the basics of the game, but here we’ll provide a quick run- down of some of the most significant changes. • Expanded Edge. Gaining and spending Edge happen more frequently than in previous editions, and some other functions have been rolled into Edge. Knowing how to gain and spend Edge is an important part of your tactics as a runner. • Simplified weapons stats. Armor penetration and recoil compensation were combined into a more abstract stat called Attack Rat- ing that is used to help players gain Edge. • Simplified skills. It’s not a perfect correla- tion, but the current skills list is essentially the same A skill groups of previous editions. • Armor is not rolled as part of the Damage Resistance test. Armor boosts your Defense Rating, which can help you gain Edge or prevent your opponent from gaining Edge, but it is not used in the Damage Resistance roll. Only Body is used for that roll. • Eliminated limits. Limits were a balancing stat for a more complicated system, but with somewhat fewer moving parts in this system (combined with more of an emphasis on speed) they did not have as strong a role to play, and so were removed. • Simplified action structure. There are two levels of actions, Minor and Major, and to- gether with a simpler Initiative system, they focus on keeping combat moving while flat- tening the difference somewhat between fast characters and others. • Spells don’t use Force. The power and effect of spells can still be amplified, but they don’t have to be, so you can just use spells as a basic package if you want, without having to declare Force. • Changed functions of Matrix attributes. Since there are no more limits, the functions of Matrix attributes are changed. They help determine Attack Ratings and Defense Rat- ings in the Matrix, and they also help deter- mine the approach you’ll take to hacking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Does that cover everything? Of course not! That’s why we have a full rulebook! So get ready to dive in to the next version of Shadowrun, and see if you can be fast enough, strong enough, clev- er enough, or deadly enough to stay ahead of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposition, make a big score, and stick it to the Man. They’re trying to keep you down&mdash;Shadow- run exists to you can show them they can’t. Learn the game, have fun, try new things, do something wild, and make the kind of gaming stories you’ll be telling for years!</p>

<p class="calibre1">Four Square by CZ Wright</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I hope this one’s good at talking to people,” Source said, resting her boots on the small, wobbly dining table. She focused her dark eyes on Nash. “Because you’re ter- rible at it.” “She’s right,” Tower said, swinging his feet from a seat on the kitchen counter. “Sometimes you can’t keep your head.” Nash winced, removed a stray sock from her sink, and dropped it into a yellowed laundry bag. “Vee vouched for her and said she was a good talker. At this point, I’ll settle for anyone we can trust.” “Speaking of which, why are we meeting her in your apartment?” Source said. “One, I trust Vee’s judgement; and two, this isn’t my only apartment, dumbass.” A knock on the front door sparked a flurry of activity. Nash chucked the bag into the nearest closet and stepped to the front door. She peered through the peephole. Tower hopped down and into a proper chair. He smoothed his neatly trimmed black hair, straightened his glasses, and sat upright with perfect posture. Source chuckled to herself while lighting another cigarette. “At least she’s punctual,” Nash said. She glanced at the others. “We good?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tower nodded mechanically, Source waved her hand airily. Nash disengaged the locks and swung open the door. In the hall, a skinny troll woman in a hoodie and jeans, rocking pink hair and lips, hoisted a hand in greet- ing. “I’m Rose.” “Nash. Come on in.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">I love this gig. Last month, I acted the cold-blooded killer and intimidated my opposition into submission. Last week, I played a spacey airhead and literally got away with murder. And now, I’m all glamour and class and after something hidden in a palace. I tossed my hair over my shoulder (hairstyle preset #29LBr, perfect for playing the flirt) as I approached a featureless metal door and the liveried man standing be- side it. The entrance was well-hidden around the side of the lavish mansion where my employer had sent me for a simple snatch-and-grab from a fellow I’ll call “Mr.&nbsp;Mc- Guffin,” whom I should find inside. The thing I love about working alone is the freedom you get to rock whatever looks, attitude&mdash;hell, whatever personality you feel like in any given moment. When no one knows who you are, it’s easier to inhabit the moment. Or, in this case, the character. At my approach, the man beside the door straightened up. “Ma’am,” he said with a businesslike nod. He pointed to the front of the mansion and the well-lit drive teeming with expensive cars and wealthy people. “You want the main entrance around the way. This door’s for the help.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">SIXTH WORLD // FOUR SQUARE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m in the right place, thank you,” I said and present- ed my forged invitation in augmented reality. The young man reviewed it with a sigh. After a cursory glance over the invitation, the young man reached to open the door, but then he did a double-take. My heart froze while he studied the invitation, a scowl creasing his face. His pale eyes swung up to meet mine, cold with a weird mix of aparthy and suspicion. “This don’t look like the others,” he said. “If you’ll look again, you’ll see it’s perfectly legiti- mate,” I said, keeping my face calm while my heart ric- ocheted around the inside of my ribcage. Bless him, he did look again, and for the moment his attention was on AR, I magicked a hint of influence&mdash;an extra, bare- ly perceptible, magical nudge to back me up&mdash;and said, “My invitation is acceptable. You can let me right in.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">A moment’s fog. His scowl retreated, and he pulled open the door, magically taking my words as truth, if not a direct order. “Enjoy your evening, ma’am,” he said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will,” I said truthfully, and I made my way inside as quickly as I could and still maintain my charade of dignity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, we pull the guy out of the van,” Nash said, crack- ing open her second beer, “we present him to ‘Mr.&nbsp;John- son,’ and what did that bastard say?” The group sat around the apartment. Small talk had shifted to horror stories.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“He said, ‘Where’s his thumb?’” Source said with a shake of her ponytail. Rose’s eyebrows lifted. “Nowhere in our notes does it say he asked us for a thumb. He only asked for the guy,” Tower said. “You sure about that?” Source said, narrowing her eyes at Tower. “What?” Tower’s jaw dropped. “Of course I’m sure! We talked about this!” Source kept her expression stern. “C’mon, you guys, that’s my thing,” Tower said, his tone rising in pitch. Rose opened her mouth to speak, but Nash spoke first, “Your note-taking is top-notch, man. Calm down,” she said. Source’s stern expression melted, and she laughed. Tower clicked his tongue and folded his arms over his chest. Rose opened her mouth again, but Source barked a laugh and said, “So, by this point, I hear Mr.&nbsp;Johnson say he’s not going to pay us, and I’m about ready to start peeling him into pieces&mdash;” “Yeah&mdash;” Nash said, and Rose snapped her mouth closed with a smile as the others began shouting over one another. “&mdash;He says he won’t pay because we didn’t bring him what he never even asked for&mdash;” “&mdash;I’m trying to get all of you to calm down so we can talk about this,” Tower said, “and how did we not notice he didn’t have a thumb?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">FOUR SQUARE // SIXTH WORLD</p>
<p class="calibre1">“&mdash;fragging ridiculous,” Nash said. “I’m looking for cover and an out&mdash;” “Nash, dear?” Source said and tipped her head to grin at Nash. “What did your miraculous brain decide this would be a good time to say?” “Oh, shit.” Nash ran a hand through her black curls. “What did I say? It wasn’t good …” Source slapped the table good-naturedly and pointed at Rose. “This one,” she said, hitching her head toward Nash, “turns to the Johnson and says, ‘I dunno, maybe it’s up your ass. With your head stuffed so far up there, you could probably go have a look.’” Nash pursed her lips, bowed her head, and nodded. “Oh. Yeah.” Tower shook his head and closed his eyes. “Ugh.” Source broke into a grin. “And that’s when they start- ed shooting!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once past the guard and inside the house&mdash;if such a massive and opulent thing could be called a “house” any- more&mdash;I found the locker room. The forger I had bought the invitation from had information for sale, too. For a few nuyen more, I was working with a map of the house and the locker combination of an employee I could re- semble who wouldn’t be here tonight. I wondered wheth- er the map and combination were going to be as solid as the invitation (which is to say, shoddy as shit), but there wasn’t much to be done about it now, with my being alone and on-site already. In a few minutes, I wore a simple black uniform. I examined the badge clipped to the bottom of the shirt. It read “Charlotte” and bore a photo of a mousy-look- ing young woman. I could do that, I thought, and hid in a bathroom stall to fill out the look. I shifted my long brown hair to dishwater blond, short and messy preset #82SBl. While my artificial hair changed color, length, and texture, I shifted the tiny plates under the skin of my face into preset #3PE, which was close enough to Char- lotte that it needed only a tweak or two to prove a ser- viceable match. After a couple more minutes, I wiped the sweat from my brow and popped a painkiller&mdash;changing your face like that hurts like hell, both when you’re doing it and for a while afterward. But a look in the mirror told me I looked enough like Charlotte to work. The din from plates, pans, and people in the kitchen served me well. No one looked askance as I grabbed a tray of drinks and exited out into the party. A chaos of music and light met me past the swinging doors and inside the Great Hall. Painted and festooned people danced with abandon on the ground floor before me, while swank folks with drinks mingled serenely on the several balconies&mdash;no, one huge balcony&mdash;that spi- raled up into the starlight-speckled dome ceiling high above our heads. While the music, the lighting, and the sights made it easier to blend in, they were going to make it that much more difficult to find Mr.&nbsp;McGuffin.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got two of their guns bricked before you two even get into the van,” Tower said with a grin, all pretense of cool aloofness forgotten. “I did the best I could considering someone couldn’t keep her hands off them.” Nash stared at Source point- edly. Source shrugged. “What do you want? Is it a crime to do what you love for a living?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, in this case, actually … yes,” Tower said. “This from the guy who said I was wasting my money with that spirit combat training&mdash;” Source said. “&mdash;I said no such thing!” “&mdash;Who knew just what to do to save your hoop when that cloud of diesel exhaust manifested inside our van and tried to pull your insides out?” “I only said your money might be better spent else- where&mdash;” “&mdash;Your unconscious form, I might add, Mr.&nbsp;Ma- trix&mdash;” “&mdash;have since learned I was mistaken,” Tower said. “Thank you for saving my hoop yet again, oh Wise One,” Rose held her hands out and said, “I’m sorry to inter- rupt, but did you say earlier that Mr.&nbsp;Johnson wanted a thumb?” “Yeah!” Nash shouted and threw her hands up, looser and louder since the beers kicked in. “The bastard didn’t even ask for it!” “Sure he asked for it&mdash;by not paying us!” Source said, and the two women roared with laughter. “Tell her about the ramp,” Tower said, wrinkling his nose. “Oh, my sweet Ghost, the damned ramp,” Nash said. She pinched the bridge of her nose. “I just want to state, for the record, that I have put a drek-ton of money into that damned van after that stunt&mdash;” “For the sake of all that is holy, why are you like this?” Source said. “Cut to the chase for the girl, please.” Nash narrowed her eyes. “Fine. The chase,” she said and squared herself before Rose. “Rotodrones punching holes through our roof, Mr.&nbsp;Johnson’s thugs pulling up on our ass, and I’m driving like a mani- ac through a part of town where they care wheth- er you drive like a maniac.” She sat up straight and held up her palms. “But it’s okay, ’cause I know my way around.” Source began to laugh, and Nash talk- ed a little louder. “Sure, the streets are clogged with people. Sure, the one-ways are ludicrous, but I know where I’m going, so it’s okay.” “So saith she who turned off GridGuide because its voice annoyed her,” Tower said. “It was obnoxious!” Nash said. “You could have just turned off the voice&mdash;” Tower said. “&mdash;And that’s when Nash decided to take a shortcut!” Source shouted over them. Tower laughed. “That bridge is always closed! Always!” Nash said. Source beamed a smile at Rose. “Except today.” “Except today we’re barreling down the street, dudes still on our tail,” Nash said, “and the bridge&mdash;that should be down&mdash;is opening. The gate is down, there’s cars all backed up&mdash;” “&mdash;And I tell you to punch it,” Source said. “Yes, you did,” Nash said, shaking her head, “and I’m like, ‘Are you insane?’” “&mdash;And I said, ‘Trust me.’” Nash and Source exchanged a weighted glance, and Nash looked back at Rose. “So I did. I punched it. I thought, maybe if she’s wrong, I can still make this jump, if I just get going fast enough.” Source nodded to herself. “But there was no need. I don’t know many spells, but one thing I know how to do is barriers, and barriers can be shaped into a ramp.” Tower closed his eyes. “I really wish you could run</p>
<p class="calibre1">SIXTH WORLD // FOUR SQUARE</p>
<p class="calibre1">some numbers while you were making these kinds of de- cisions.” Source chortled. “And we hit the ramp,” Nash clapped her hand on the table and flung it upward. “And we’re fucking flying. I’m screaming like a lunatic&mdash;” “I’m sure we’re going to die&mdash;” Tower said mat- ter-of-factly. “And I drop that fragging spell right before the car behind us would hit it, and they go off, down, down, into the river below,” Source said, beaming with a huge grin. “And somehow we hit the other side of that bridge&mdash;” Nash said. “In one piece!” Source said. “Tell that to my spine,” Tower said. “But man, that was a mess!” Nash said and shook her head. She took a long pull from her beer. “But listen to me go on and on.” Nash set down her beer and held her palm out toward Rose. “Tell us more about what you do.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">After an hour or two of searching and getting occa- sionally waylaid by guests assuming I was the help, I fi- nally found him chatting up a circle of admirers on the top tier of the balcony, right beneath the dome. The trouble was, two guards blocked the way up. I wasn’t sure I wanted to test my employee badge on them; something told me neither employee status nor invitation would get me past them. If I were right and I attracted their notice, I would have a much harder time getting out of here. If I’d had accomplices, maybe one of them could have helped me out with a distraction or an exit, but again: just me. I was hours into this job and this soirée, and sick of pretending to be the help. I had served all the drinks from my tray long ago, and now I just carried around a bunch of empty glasses to maintain the disguise, because if you’re the help and your hands are empty, you’re wrong. Having to haul around trays of things was certainly one of the big downsides of this sort of disguise, or so my shoulders were screaming, but it kindled an idea. I set down my tray in a less-populated spot on the balcony and scanned the crowds for what I needed. First, I found the two dancers I’d scoped out earlier while on the hunt for my mark. With all of my magic masked, of course, I cast a pair of Control Emotion spells to make them more skittish. After that, I gently magicked a set of Magic Fingers to pull an abandoned glass off a table, safely through the balcony railing, and drop it into freefall. The tumbler tumbled, and the glass shattered among the dancers below. Several screams rang out, audible over the music, and all heads swiveled. As the screams below dissolved into self-conscious laughter, I slipped past the guards with a bit more aid from an Invisibility spell. From there, it was much simpler. I talked my mark away from his admirers, having convinced all of them I was someone he knew. I helped him believe a promise I had no intention of keeping in order to get close to him and gave him a peck on the cheek with my laced lipstick for appearances’ sake. Then I just palmed what I’d come to retrieve and got the frag out. Rose finished speaking and took a pull from her drink. Tower glanced back and forth between the others and said, tentatively, “So … what did you take?” Rose pursed her lips, looked over the others, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">reached carefully into an inner hoodie pocket. She set a wrapped something on the table and flipped aside the napkin. Inside the napkin was a large, pasty, adult-sized thumb. Where the rest of the hand would attach, there 13 was only a silver port. Rose watched Source, Tower, and Nash as they first stared at the thumb, then between one another. “Is it me, or could that be our boy’s thumb?” Source said. Nash’s eyes lifted to meet Rose’s and narrowed. “No, I don’t think it’s just you,” Tower said. “What gives?” Nash said. Rose shrugged. “You mentioned it. It was a weird thing to get hired to grab, you remember these things.” “No, I get that,” Nash said and rose to her feet. “But how’d you get that? Who hired you?” she snapped. “Whoa, hey,” Tower said. “Relax&mdash;” Source said quietly. “I just said how,” Rose said. “As for who hired me, your guess is as good as mine. Probably someone acting against your employer. We’re all freelance; these things happen.” Nash’s jaw tightened. “Look, if you don’t start giving me answers, I’m going to&mdash;” “No, enough of this either-or bulldrek! Calm down!” Tower shouted. The women stared at him in varying degrees of shock. “This is the same problem we keep facing, and if we don’t stop to acknowledge it, it’s going to keep getting in our way,” Tower said more quietly this time. He moved to stand before Nash and reached to put his hands on her shoulders before picking up on the charge in Nash’s eyes that told him to consider otherwise. “All I’m asking is that you stop and think for a second. She told us the story. Whether we believe her story&mdash;sorry, Rose,” he said with an apologetic look to the troll. “It’s okay,” Rose said. “&mdash;we still know she didn’t pull that run on us. We got the guy and brought him straight to Mr.&nbsp;Johnson. It’s not her fault that Mr.&nbsp;Johnson wasn’t up front with what he wanted. If he had been, we probably would have noticed the guy’s thumb was already missing before we grabbed him.” Tower looked from Nash to Rose again. “I’m go- ing to guess this soirée of yours was on the fourteenth or earlier?” Rose nodded. “Yeah, the night of the fourteenth.” Nash’s expression softened. “And we grabbed him in the wee hours of the fifteenth.” “Laced lipstick,” Source said with a snort, “No won- der he was so easy to grab. I assumed he was blitzed.” “And after everything we already told her,”Tower said, “I’m willing to bet she could track down our Mr.&nbsp;John- son, turn in the thumb, and keep all the pay for herself. But instead …” He waved toward the napkin-wrapped digit on the table. Rose shrugged. “I can’t work alone anymore. I need folks watching my back, and you seem like decent people. That and Vee vouched for y’all. I could probably smooth things out and turn this in for that payday you’re owed, and maybe we can consider our splitting that payday to be a team-warming gift from me to you?” Nash shook her head and dropped back into her seat. She stared at the thumb. “Fine. You do all that&mdash;plus you get that damned thing off my kitchen table&mdash;and you’re hired.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">FOUR SQUARE // SIXTH WORLD</p>
<p class="calibre1">I still remember the day I saw a dragon fly over Times Square. People don’t talk about that one. They talk about Ryumyo appearing in the skies above Mount Fuji on Christmas Eve, 2011. They talk about January 12, 2012 when Dunkelzahn appeared in Denver. Hell, that one is a national holiday in the UCAS. By the time I came into this world, it was common to see dragons. Ryumyo, Dunkelzahn, Hestaby, Alamais, Nachtmeister, Lowfyr, and so on. I grew up knowing the name of every great dragon like they were celebrities or athletes. I even bought the trading cards. Today you hear Johnny Spinrad’s name spoken in the same breath as Lowfyr. Even dragons became ordinary as we looked for the next big thing. Want to know the secret to the Sixth World? You’re spe- cial until something else comes along. Dragons re- main a symbol of everything changed in the world. Change in the Sixth World&mdash;the name we gave to our reality when magic came into it&mdash;isn’t neces- sarily good. The old reality still mattered after the change. We watched the old trid shows and ate the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same crap. The world evolved slowly&mdash;some say it degraded. For the dragons, change meant exposure to the ailments of this world. These once-mythical creatures became wrapped up in the mundane hu- man world. They showed up on TV, opened bars&mdash; one even ran for president of the UCAS. And won. Then the dragons began to die. Their deaths were viewed as earthshaking events, on par with the planet’s biggest celebrities, and those events changed our feelings about these creatures. Sud- denly they were mortal, like the rest of us. If some- thing is mortal, then we can kill it. Half the dragons I mentioned are dead or missing. Each death rat- tled the world like an earthquake, forcing the pow- ers that be to scramble and realign. That’s where we come in. That’s how we make our living day to day. Wars aren’t always fought on the battlefield or even in the media anymore. They happen in the shadows, where the public understand only the outcome, not the process that led to it. And some- times not even that. If you know where to look and how, though, you can start to uncover the play-by-</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE LIFE YOU HAVE LEFT //</p>
<p class="calibre1">play of a shadowrun, or even a shadow war. That report about a warehouse in Renton that burned down followed by a break-in at a Centurion se- cured storage facility and the accidental drowning death of a noted Mitsuhama scientist days after? All three were part of the same shadowrun to de- lete all traces of evidence of what Mitsuhama was working on. You didn’t hear about the Matrix at- tack on a Mitsuhama datastore, because they con- trolled that information. You didn’t hear about the security action in the Redmond Barrens to track down the runners who did the job, because people in the Barrens are too poor to get noticed by the media. These are the lives we lead, defined by an- onymity. Trust me when I tell you it is better to be anon- ymous than to be special. Life in the Sixth World is like the game King of the Hill, where everyone wrestles to reach the top, and once you’re up there, everyone else tries to knock you down. In the wake of those battles, you start to figure out who has what position in the hierarchy. The biggest kids are the hardest to move, and the little guys have to work fast to figure out how things work. You see, our world even eats the dragons, so what chance to do you and I really have to stay at the top? Here’s a news flash, chummer. You’re the little guy, and you don’t have much time to figure it out. Start now.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Born this Way There’s this idea that people end up where they are in life because that is what they are suited for. That part can be a crutch for those who deal in ex- cuses. However, there are many factors in our life besides ability. Birth and opportunity put us in a starting position that is tough to shake. I was born into a world of emerging races, shifting demo- graphics, new rising magic, corporate overreach and overrule. My world was defined by crowded streets, food shortages, disease, poverty, and crime. If you’re reading this, you were born into the after- math of my world. As I look around, I’m starting to think that my generation had it easy. There were still choices in the beginning. People were figuring out the rules and trying to find their way in all of this. Trying to understand where they fit in. The old-school guys from the ’40s and ’50s made their own way. They cut themselves a slice of the pie when there was still pie to be had. Some of them even hung up the trenchcoat and put on a suit, sell- ing out to corporate interests. Some went the other direction&mdash;slipping away from corporate life and into the shadows. You have some choices left. What to wear, what to eat, where to shop. These things are yours, so long as your corporate overlords say they are. You see, they built a system that was meant to keep us separated, powerless, and ignorant. All that is</p>
<p class="calibre1">fine if you are a drone, but what happens if you want more than the special ramen on Wednesdays? What opportunities do you have to get more? Play by the rules, and you find out really quick- 15 ly that the world is built to put you in a box. That same world needs you to pay bills and buy drek you don’t actually need. You’re the fuel for the cor- porate machine. Where you are on the food chain depends on where you started out. Despite what the corps would have you believe, most people ar- en’t born into corporate servitude. The majority of people come into the world with an unaligned System Identification Number or SIN, which is is- sued to them in the hospital or administered by sanctioned midwifes. Being born into the system means that the first fifteen or so years of your life are already decided. You go to school, get tested for magical aptitude around middle school, and are tracked into ca- reer-field classes just in time for high school. Things are the same if you’re born a corporate citizen or into a functioning government. The options nar- row for the Awakened. They narrow even further for those of us born metahuman. The best most of us can hope for is to find work as a salaryman slinging Arrogant Gargoyle at the corner Stuffer Shack. The system works to support the corpora- tions and criminalize any freedoms that threaten the corps, such as workers voluntarily taking their services to employers willing to pay. It became il- legal to switch corporations without corporate ap- proval. So, in order to better their lives, wageslaves needed the complex series of movements carried out by those of us who work in the shadows. Shad- owrunners are problem solvers. Because we exist outside of the system, we are not beholden to it. I bluffed my way into a charter school with a faked SIN and got enough of an education to be- come a decent hacker and get out of the system. Others I grew up with weren’t so lucky&mdash;gangs treat schools like a draft pool. It is rare to see a city kid get out without aligning themselves to one faction or another. Even corp kids have gangs to worry about. After a while, it becomes a lifestyle. Not everyone is lucky enough to be born with those choices. Many people are born poor and can- not afford to go to a hospital and be properly reg- istered. Like me, they don’t get formal education unless they find a way to fake their paperwork. Undocumented people are treated as a drain on so- ciety, overlooked and relegated to the poorest parts of every urban sprawl. That’s right, your worth is dependent on the whims of corporations and gov- ernments and who they decide to give paperwork to. Awesome, right? Anyway, SINs became a way of defining who was and who wasn’t a person. Not everyone can even apply. The Corporate Court’s 2072 acknowledgment of metaspecies sapience presently defines which species can or can’t apply for a SIN. Down here in the streets, we know the</p>
<p class="calibre1">BORN THIS WAY // THE LIFE YOU HAVE LEFT</p>
<p class="calibre1">real qualifying test is money. In Dunkelzahn’s last will and testament, he used his draconic wealth to provide thousands of SINs to the disenfranchised. 16 He was helping people get into the system, but nobody ever stopped to ask if being part of that system was a good idea, or if we should continue to survive, and in some cases thrive, outside of it. Shadowrunning is a survival mechanism. It is impossible to work at a Stuffer Shack, let alone hold a desk job, without a SIN. But on our side of the street, a SIN makes life more difficult. You get caught, and they know who you are. They know your history and your address, if you’re not care- ful. That’s why we take on street names. It’s an al- ter ego, a way to do business without risking the little bit of a life you’ve scraped together for your- self. Without some form of identity&mdash;your per- sonal brand&mdash;you don’t have many choices. Sure, you can still lift yourself out of the barrens on a football or urban-brawl scholarship, but most of us don’t make it fifteen blocks from where we grew up. After a time, we stop looking for ways to make it out. That’s the truth for most of us, but like I said, things are different if you’re special. So let’s look at the ways to be special.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Awakened There is still debate about what magic actu- ally is. A magician channels magic in a different way than a shaman or an adept. Both of these are attached to concepts we call mana and Es- sence, which are simple labels for connections to things and powers that we do not understand. Back in ’22, this e-rag called Data coined the term “Awakened.” To be born Awakened means having the ability to manipulate mana. With this power, you can summon spirits out of thin air, conjure a fireball and send it racing down an alley, or even leave your own flesh behind and travel through the shadowy realm known as astral space. Some peo- ple can channel mana through their own bodies, giving them freakish abilities like outrunning a car or punching through a brick wall. Magic opened new doors. Suddenly, there was another way out of the barrens outside of sports and sex. Kids born with the ability had choices. MIT added another T (for Thaumaturgy) and became MIT&amp;T, and it offered scholarships that lifted kids out of poverty. It wasn’t all good news and warm feelings. People don’t talk about what happened in the high schools. Mages, shamans, and adepts all faced ridicule and abuse until they figured out how they could use their powers effec- tively. The shadows are filled with stories like Re- becca, who’d been bullied her entire life, sudden- ly learning how to chuck a powerball. Once they started hurting people, the law wasn’t on their side anymore. The way things went bad was different in every country. Many Awakened children were</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE LIFE YOU HAVE LEFT // BORN THIS WAY</p>
<p class="calibre1">beaten to death by lynch mobs in the early days. Some of the more religious countries branded mag- ic users as demons and punished them accordingly. This didn’t go on for long before they realized folks were wasting a valuable commodity. The arms race had changed. Eventually the corpora- tions tried to seize control of every magical asset they could, in order to have control of a com- modity that everyone else coveted. Corps snapped up the Awakened people and spirits to the point where being born a normal human, though they were still a vast majority, felt like a disadvantage. Basic supply and demand. The Awakened live in a different world than we do, one that is quite liter- ally more magical. If you were born Awakened and the tooth fairy showed up at the foot of your bed after you lost that first tooth, odds are it wasn’t a dream. She was probably somebody’s spirit ally who came by to check up on you and potentially recruit you to their side. Magic and technology don’t mix well. In fact, they tend to operate like different ends of a spec- trum. If you’re one of the Awakened, then any tech- nology joined to your body disrupts the flow of mana. The more ’ware you have, the weaker your connection to magic. Before we really understood or had access to other countermeasures, prison fa- cilities used to perform invasive operations, install- ing monitoring cyberware in criminal magic users as a way to deny them access to their abilities. Be- cause the more powers the world invents, the more creative the tortures and punishments are to stop them. But while we’re talking about tech, let’s dive into that a little more.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack in and Tune Out Once the new smell of magic wore off, tech scraped back into the spotlight. 2024 was the birth of simsense. This was an evolution of virtual real- ity that allowed you to sink completely into a dig- itally realized reality indistinguishable from real life. Simsense works off of Artificial Sensory In- duction System Technology (ASIST), which allows a person to disconnect from their physical senses and truly feel (and taste and smell) sensory im- pressions recorded on a chip. It presented an easy enough way out of a world that couldn’t promise anything. Unlike video games, simsense lets you really feel the recorded experiences of individuals as they lived. Instead of watching a movie, you ex- perienced it down to the heart-pumping sensations of fear, happiness, anger, even lust. You could dive through the clouds in a fighter jet, experience the rush of chasing down a criminal through Seattle streets, or even be that criminal running for his life as the jackboots of Lone Star officers close in. Sim- sense can record everything a person experiences and feed you that same experience. Naturally, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tech spawned a black market of better-than-life chips (BTLs) that offered irregular, amped-up ex- periences, and even snuff chips. ASIST technology merged with Direct Neural 17 Interface to form the basic technological premise of what we call the Matrix. You jack into a com- puter network and you’re in another world. De- pending on the intricacy of the code, it can feel like the real thing. Hackers take it one step fur- ther, running hot, without the safety parameters engaged to have a faster response time. It comes with risks. Run hot and biofeedback can be lethal. ASIST kills. Between 2064 and 2075 ASIST killed more than 21,000 Matrix users. Those are just the deaths reported by the corporations and the gov- ernment. We know the number is higher. ASIST led to the development of vehicle control rigs (VCR). That technology is the backbone of the transport industry. It makes it possible for us to jack into vehicles, drones, and even security networks and control them with a thought. Tech moves so fast these days that it is hard to believe that the modern Matrix is barely over half a century old. In that time, we’ve gone from link- ing into keyboard-sized cyberdecks to handheld wireless commlinks that sync to the local grid. The Matrix used to be a thing you had to jack into. Now it impacts the physical world through aug- mented-reality objects. Twice, the Matrix crashed and burned, rising from its digital ashes as a more robust version of its former self. In the wake of the last Crash, corporate organizations banded togeth- er in order to reshape the Matrix into Danielle de la Mar’s vision of a global grid of networks regu- lated by a singular authority called GOD, or Grid Overwatch Division. We live in the Orichalcum Age of the Matrix, but we still don’t understand the secrets it holds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Cyber Revolution There are choices we make, and those that are made for us. Your parents were wageslaves, or maybe you were a sprawl baby. You are born a particular race, with all of the discrimination that comes with it. You are born Awakened or not. A very small number of us are born technomancers with the ability to slice through the Matrix with your mind. The rest of us are left with choices. Technology creates a lot of choices if you can bar- ter or steal your way under the knife. The simultaneous growth of technology and magic meant that there was still a chance to be of value without being born Awakened. Going under the knife, already as commonplace as getting your teeth cleaned, became a necessity to remain a part of this world. It is near impossible to work an of- fice job without a datajack. “Fresh meat” is consid- ered inefficient. If the ’ware is too expensive to buy outright, there are other options. Shadowrunners</p>
<p class="calibre1">BORN THIS WAY // THE LIFE YOU HAVE LEFT</p>
<p class="calibre1">ESCAPE ROUTES Daily life in the sprawl can be a grind. Everybody’s looking for a chance to slip away and find some excitement or a life more interesting than the 9 to 9 they spend behind a desk. The majority of people don’t spend their leisure time in the phys- ical world. The birth of ASIST technology meant that you no longer had to be there to be there. Biological advancements in drug tech alongside the mining of magical properties of plants mean there are more avenues of escape, depending on how much risk the user is willing to take on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">BTL chips Better-than-life chips offer an experience beyond what the average person can hope for. Jack in with your full ASIST activated, and you can feel everything being cast through the chip experience. This isn’t just a high, it is full sensory dive into a life a lot better than yours. Or anyone’s. BTLs lack the safety protocols built into standard simsense chips, so you feel exactly what the original creator felt, regardless of whether your body can handle it. BTL-related deaths are second only to murders in global causes of death.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Powders and Pills Drug use is rampant in the Sixth World, but biotech advance- ments have made it easier for users to hide their addiction. Tra- ditional escapist drugs such as novacoke and the psychedelic zen are joined on the market by newer drugs derived from magi- cal substances. Wageslaves unable to keep up with the workload find themselves needing to use short-term amphetamines like</p>
<p class="calibre1">cram just to make it through the day.Many corporations have to drug-test their employees in accordance with the Corporate Court ruling governing corporations seeking extraterritorial sta- tus. As a result, there is a thriving market of supplements and other solutions to help you fool these tests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Video Games Gaming has been a way to slip out of your daily grind since the days of the first computers. We’ve come a long way from Zork. MMORPGs offer a full range of experiences for everyone from the casual gamer to hikikomori. Miracle Shooter re- mains the top online game due to an impressive competitive balance of grind requirements and a free entry point. Horizon’s 2076 release V-World rates a close second and is the only top ten game whose focus is not combat. Gaming addiction is on the rise as is virtual trauma disorder, a condition similar to PTSD resulting from stressful encounters in the gaming world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Drone Casting From virtual vacations to deep-space or deep-sea explo- rations, hitch a ride on a drone. Services offer monthly fees to explore the world through the eyes of a drone. There is a drone feed for every taste. Evo’s Gagarin Prime lets you experience the dust storms of Mars. The ever-popular Crimewatch allows you to follow Lone Star police takedowns. Fly guy lets you voy- euristically observe city life in any major city you want to see. Guided drone tours of landmarks and ruins have replaced field trips as part of the elementary school experience.</p>
<p class="calibre1">are the original high-tech lowlifes. Find second- hand ’ware. Cut a deal with a supplier or local doc to provide muscle in exchange for the cyber. Offer yourself up as a guinea pig for experimental ’ware to an outfit like the Grey Brothers. Cyberware became the great equalizer. It also became a way to stand out in the world if you wanted to. You can choose to be a hacker and buy implants that improve your abilities to inter- face with the Matrix. You can choose to be a rig- ger, swapping the precious meatspace along your spine for a VCR. You can embed ballistic plates below the skin, improving your odds of survival as a shooter. You can mount spring-loaded weap- ons in your forearms, so you’re never outmatched in hand-to-hand combat. Are you the type who wants to blend in, with cyberware that is made to appear human? Are you the type who wants to stand out with oversized mechanical parts and burning red eyes? Do you see your body as a piece of art, sculpted from futuristic-looking cyber- limbs? Perhaps you’ve chosen to abandon human form entirely for an arachnid base and arms rem- iniscent of a Hindu god. Cyberware and bioware were meant to level the playing field, but instead they created entirely new avenues of expression and opportunity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Biology wasn’t standing still during all of this. For every cybernetic advancement, scientists at- tempted to find a biological equivalent. Bioware advances kept pace for a while, but in the end it was clear that metal outperforms meat every time. However, metal comes with a price tag beyond the nuyen you lay on the table. Cyberware means a life of constant surgical upkeep in order to remain state of the art. For some, it can become an addic- tion. Rumors abound of shadowrunners who went beyond what the body could tolerate. They became more machine than man and the metal drove them insane. We call them cyberzombies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grease in the Gears Through all that I’ve shared so far there is a constant reminder that progress moves through the dark. That idea is ever present in the name we are given: shadowrunners. To borrow a phrase, we are deniable assets. We take a lot of the lan- guage of what we are from the spy game, but un- like spies we don’t serve a specific government or agenda. Shadowrunners keep the wheels turning. We do the off-the-books work that enables the</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE LIFE YOU HAVE LEFT // GREASE IN THE GEARS</p>
<p class="calibre1">system to keep running as if everything in the world is okay. Shadowrunning isn’t a way out. Nobody goes into the life thinking they’ll be a millionaire and move to a twenty-five-meter yacht. That isn’t to say it can’t happen. Success just looks different this deep in the shadows. Success looks like staying alive and keeping a roof over your head. For some, success looks like doing real good in the world or at least making a difference. Shadowrunning is not noble work, but it can be. Those of us who call ourselves street samurai adhere to a code of honor. This doesn’t mean I won’t shoot you in the face if I have to, but it means I’ll look you in the eyes before I do it. Choosing to live the life of a shadowrunner is not an easy one. Once I made that choice doors closed behind me, narrowing who I could be. You still have choices to make and an impossible world to navigate. You can still take the easy way out and be a drone. Jack in every day and let them guide you along the well-paved road. Or you could step out into the world and look around. Just re- member to look behind your back every so often, because in this world, trouble never comes at you from where you expected. If you are going to run, there are a couple of things you need to know before you get started.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The first is employment. We are, after all, at-will laborers working for the most dangerous forces on the planet. The man doing the hiring almost al- ways goes by the same name. 19 Meeting Mr.&nbsp;Johnson A common misconception is that we only work for the corps or the criminals. The nature of shad- owrunners as off-the-book agents of change means that we can work for practically anyone. Corps and crooks may be the groups that get play on the tri- deo, but shadowrunners work for anyone willing to pay. The thing is, we aren’t supposed to know who we work for. That’s part of the appeal to our employers. Most shadowruns happen through an intermediary known collectively as Mr.&nbsp;Johnson. Sexist, I know, but the gendered term helps rein- force anonymity. Not knowing who you work for means deniability on both sides. The way it works is, you or someone you know is contacted by Mr.&nbsp;Johnson. You set up an initial meeting where terms of the job are discussed. A small down payment is generally offered up front to secure your services, and then you go to work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Legwork Shadowrunning isn’t all shoot-’em-ups and slic- ing through IC, though a lot of us wish it were. Being good at what we do means doing research and connecting with people. Once we get the job, we have to do our due diligence. Never assume that Mr.&nbsp;Johnson told you the en- tire story. You’ll only get as much information as they think you need to know. Any runner who goes into a run solely on Mr.&nbsp;Johnson’s info is likely to be carried out by a DocWagon team&mdash;if you’re lucky. Use your connections to find out what they aren’t telling you. Any good runner is going to make friends in the circles they can’t get into them- selves. If you’re not a mage, meet one. Get to know a smuggler. Find contacts in the corporations who can give you information you’ll need to do your job. Above all else, find a fixer. As the name sug- gests, they’ll have the answers you don’t. They know what jobs need to be done, and they excel at connecting teams to the jobs they can pull off. You want to be one of the teams a fixer trusts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the Run Runs aren’t necessarily one type of thing; there- fore, you’ll need to put together a flexible team that can respond to any situation that presents itself. You need someone good with their hands and/or a long gun. It is important to have someone who can do the talking. You’ll need someone to do the driving away when talking doesn’t work, or just when you need to get from point A to point B,</p>
<p class="calibre1">GREASE IN THE GEARS // THE LIFE YOU HAVE LEFT</p>
<p class="calibre1">fast. Break-in and recovery inevitably require Ma- trix support, so you’ll need a good hacker. Magic users&mdash;spellcasters, summoners, enchanters, what 20 have you&mdash;are your ace in the hole, if you’re lucky enough to find one. What shadowrunners do is frequently illegal, so conceal your identity, especially if you’re un- lucky enough to have a SIN. Remember what Mr.&nbsp;Johnson asked you to do, and more importantly advised you not to do. Shadowruns are delicate operations that rarely leave room for collateral damage. Be professional. Every run is an audition for the next one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting Paid All too often, the most dangerous part of any run is getting paid for it. Mr.&nbsp;Johnson’s anonymity means that nobody knows who they are if they de- cide to screw you over. You’re not going to be able to take them to small-claims court or anything if they don’t pay. How you’ve decided to get paid shapes the interaction. Traditionally, runners are paid in one of three ways: untraceable credsticks, corp scrip, or equipment. The presumption is that they wouldn’t pay you in their own scrip&mdash;that is, if they pay you in Ares dollars, they’re likely from anywhere but Ares. Running for gear may be the only way to gain access to rare and illegal goods. Some Johnsons like to deal in corp scrip as a way to throw you off the employer’s scent, but the downside is that you have to find a way to spend it or locate a scrip exchange. If you’re given a choice, credsticks are the way to go. Certified credsticks contain funds backed by the Zurich-Orbital Ge- meinschaftsbank. Those funds are good anywhere. I’d say they’re worth their weight in gold, but the currency is nothing more than digital encryption. It has no weight. But I digress. Once terms have been established and a loca- tion for the payout decided, it can be a good idea to treat the meet with the same level of caution you would any other stage of the run. Make sure to scout the location ahead of time, maintain security where possible, and always be on your guard. Mr.&nbsp;Johnson may be looking to clean up any loose ends connected to the run, so don’t make it easy for him to erase you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Downtime So you got a job. You took all the right steps, pulled it off, and got paid. What now? We live our lives between shadowruns. That means doing more than cleaning our weapons, studying spells, and maintaining the contacts we need to survive. In other words, the runs are a means to an end. Each of your employers has their agenda and reason for being, so between jobs you ought to be asking yourself, what is yours?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten Ways to Make a Living in the Shadows Extraction Once a valuable employee decides to make a move to another corporation, they must find a way to get away from their employer and to the other corporation. Extractions are not necessarily friendly. Often a corporation will kidnap a targeted employee. They haven’t agreed to the transfer. They’ll have no idea you are coming, and they might well resist the entire time. Furthermore, extraction orders don’t always include the target’s family. It is common to show up to extract a worker only to find them sitting down for family dinner. The choice to extract additional targets is ultimately yours, but in these situations you are operating without pay and outside the parameters of what you were hired to do. They might pay you in gratitude for getting them out, but be sure you’re getting them to a better place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Babysitting Often confused with bodyguard work, in this job run- ners are tasked to protect a location or a person. The job is straightforward&mdash;sit on the principal until a team arrives for retrieval. Corporations and other employers tend to farm this work out to gangs. This work is best suited for people who don’t ask questions. They don’t know or care why they were hired to sit on the principal, who hired you, or even what they are protecting. The mission is to make sure the only people who get to the principal are the ones that know the password.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Protection Detail Mr.&nbsp;Johnsons and other frontline employers need pro- tection when they meet others to do their work. Corpo- rate workers need protection when they are operating outside the boundaries of their corporations or off the books. This work differs from babysitting in that you are generally protecting the employer, so injury to the em- ployer means you don’t get paid. Beyond that, you are expected to show a level of professionalism toward the employer that you don’t have to worry about in a babysit- ting run. Often the hardest part of a protection detail is dealing with the principal. Shadowrunners who develop a talent for this kind of work often wind up up guarding trid stars and occasionally become signed on to a private security corp such as Wolverine or Centurion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Diversion In some circumstances, a location’s security cannot be breached unless that security is distracted or otherwise dis- persed. Shadowrunners can make a name for themselves getting hired by a corporation or even another runner team to cause a diversion so the primary run can succeed. Often this is high risk, because the goal of a diversion is to draw the authorities away from the real attack. That means ev- eryone will be looking at you&mdash;any heat from the job, any gunfire, will come your way. Employers are not always so direct about this kind of work, and runners may find them-</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE LIFE YOU HAVE LEFT // GREASE IN THE GEARS</p>
<p class="calibre1">selves on a run they thought was real only to discover they were the diversion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Straight Thievery We live in a world of increasingly rare and unique items. From time to time, runners are hired to steal some of these items. Occasionally they will be hired by the victim to steal the item back. Theft is a large part of working with organized crime syndicates. While bank robbery is rare, syndicates hire runners to hijack automated cargo trucks, disappear shipments of goods for the insurance, and rob stores who refuse to pay protection money. Thievery is also a common part of Matrix shadowruns. A hacker turned loose in a datastore to steal a specific file might find several other files they can sell on the black market. Taking more than you were asked to steal is frowned on by employers, but it’s incredibly hard to track or prove. Most runners view tak- ing extra stuff as valuable side income.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Datasteal Companies are always working on the next new prototype. It is often easier and cheaper to hire shadowrunners to steal a prototype and all related research data from a company than to invent new things themselves. Corporate redundancy and com- partmentalization mean that often, the data needs to be acquired from more than one location. One team of researchers could be working on part of a prototype at one location while a separate research facility holds the rest of the device. Particularly sensitive files may be stored at yet another, air-gapped location. Occasion- ally this type of work is combined with extraction when an em- ployer decides they need the scientists as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wetwork Wetwork is murder by a sweeter name. Often this kind of work needs to be done discreetly. The job needs to be made to look accidental. Runner teams like the Smoker’s Club specialize in this sort of business. Wetwork is a highly specialized and com- petitive market. Once you start to make a name for yourself,</p>
<p class="calibre1">you are likely to find yourself the target of a rival wetwork team trying to make a name for themselves or carrying out the orders of a Johnson who previously hired you. 21 Transportation Smuggling and goods transportation is the backbone of the black market. Drugs, people, telesma, and tech all move across borders. Though commonly associated with gangs and syndi- cates, NGOs and other private-sector interests frequently use smugglers to move assets. Smugglers, like thieves and assas- sins, operate as part of a larger network that includes fences and fixers. Smugglers, however, tend to be regionally based and have expert knowledge in the geographical terrain of their home territory.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bounty Hunting There will always be a market for the hides of rare animals. In the Sixth World, there is also a market for sentient critters. From the ghouls of Asamondo to Awakened storm dolphins off the coast of Australia, there are standing bounties open to any runner enterprising enough to claim them. Public and private law-enforcement services like Lone Star and Knight Errant maintain a less-exotic list of wanted criminals. Thankfully, these law enforcement organizations tend to not look too closely at who is picking up the nuyen in these situations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">White Hat Runners are sometimes hired to test the capabilities of a security system. This traditionally happens more in Matrix secu- rity than it does in physical security. White-hat runners are gen- erally instructed to not cause lasting damage to the institution they are breaking into. They aren’t supposed to harm security, and most importantly, they’re ordered to not steal anything. Unfortunately, these limitations do not apply to the security el- ements assigned to stop you. They don’t know your operation is a test, and they will employ all available means to neutralize the threat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Until you figure it out, the Sixth World is filled with distractions to occupy your time. There is a sports league for every taste. Baseball, soccer, foot- ball, hockey, and basketball are popular draws, but the modern sports connoisseur is more likely to be drawn to combat biking or urban brawl. Thanks to the trideo, you can follow your favorite team or player from anywhere on the planet (or off). Speaking of trideo, multi-sensory immersive view- ing is about the most addictive thing you can do, legally. There are channels for every taste and news trids for every political flavor. If staying in isn’t your passion, then it isn’t hard to find a joygirl or boy eager to find out what is. Sex is still the oldest and most popular pastime. The Sixth World can bring it to you, virtually or otherwise. Just be aware that everything that hap- pens in the Matrix or outside of it can wind up as someone else’s paydata. Some parts of the world</p>
<p class="calibre1">are pretty laid back about it, so you can do just about anything with as many consenting individ- uals as you want, and no one will care if someone tries to blackmail you about it. Other parts are still dealing with taboos and restrictions, so be careful about who might be watching when you cross cer- tain lines.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Powers that Be There’s far too much drek hanging over our heads to be able to take the long view. Stare up too long and you can guess what happens. So in- stead, we keep our heads down. Once in a while, the clouds part and there is a glimpse of what is going on in the larger world. Our reality exists in an employer/employee dynamic that is generally</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE POWERS THAT BE // THE LIFE YOU HAVE LEFT</p>
<p class="calibre1">filtered through a middle man. If you’re lucky, you don’t have to know who you’re working for, but sometimes it helps. The different types of employ- 22 ers can’t necessarily be stuffed into nice categories, but I’ll do my best.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragons Here’s the thing about dragons: For as much as they want to be left alone, they also want to be able to control what you’re doing, watching, and seeing. They’re like corps in that way. They fight like corps, too. Not long after UGE (I’ll cover that in a minute&mdash; see p.&nbsp;26), the great dragon Aden firebombed Tehran, killing the ayatollah and everyone else in a five-mile radius of his compound after the Muslim leader de- clared jihad on the Awakened, including metahu- mans. Aden was protecting assets, plain and simple. Still, the similarities end there. Thousands of years of tension, animosity, and planning define draconian in- teractions. There’s a story that Alamais and Dunkel- zahn used to hire runners to break into each other’s compounds every year, costing drekloads in nuyen and lives, all to deliver a fruitcake as a prank. Drag- ons have their hands in everything. Some control cit- ies or nations, such as Ghostwalker in Denver and Hualpa in Amazonia. Others have their claws deep in the world’s financial systems. Two of the top ten megas are at least partially run by great dragons. All of the great dragons have amassed fortunes beyond human comprehension, yet it is not clear what a sin- gle one of them actually wants or even cares about. They play long games, their motives are inscrutable, and it’s not clear if they care about you at all. I’ll tell you what a runner told me when I got started: Never, ever cut a deal with a dragon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Corporations The great dragons don’t live alone at the top of the food chain anymore. The day magic re- emerged, governments took a backseat to more powerful forces. Corporations became the ar- chitects of our awareness. Education, the news, even social media is filtered through outlets they control. Unlike dragons, the corporate agenda is transparent. The goal of every existing corporate structure is to make nuyen. They accomplish this goal well, and as a result, corporations influence the Sixth World more than any other type of em- ployer you will encounter. No matter how little they want to admit it, cor- porations need shadowrunners the way cars need mechanics. Working for the corps represents the bed- rock of what shadowrunners do. We are deniable as- sets. Our job is to carry out the work given to us, get paid, and forget about everything we just did. Each megacorporation has its own identity be- yond the bottom line. That identity presents itself in the kind of work they offer and more specifical-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ly, the kind of security you can expect to encounter when running against them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Public Sector Governments still matter. Sort of. Local and federal agencies work to preserve the fragile peace in the spaces between corporations. That means plenty of business for shadowrunners willing to get their hands dirty. As is the case with corpora- tions, you might find yourself hired by one part of the government to run against another in a pri- vate war to help someone move a bit further up the chain of command. Government work rarely comes from the very top. It is usually doled out by double-blind mid-level staffers anxious to make an impression on their bosses. The work you do can be small potatoes, like kidnapping a local offi- cial so they can’t make call on a critical vote. You might also find yourself caught up in a larger con- flict as many runners did when Aztlan and Amazo- nia used runners in the run up to their war.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Non-Governmental Organizations There are several other organizations that are neither corporation nor government. Their global reach and wealth make them relevant to the con- versation. NGOs are interest-based organizations often founded by wealthy donors or through mon- ey funneled through legitimate governments. The Atlantean Foundation and the Black Lodge are two organizations founded by magic users and whose primary interests are magic and the recovery of magical items, while the Draco Foundation and the somewhat-related Dunkelzahn Institute of Magical Research were born out of a dragon’s hoard and exist to carry out his will beyond the grave. Several popular NGOs known as policlubs ex- ist to promote racial division. The Humanis Poli- club is the most well-known. They see human and meta as a black-and-white division, like good vs.&nbsp;evil. One guess as to which side they think is good. While Humanis is the pinnacle of rage, hatred comes from both sides of the racial divide. That work is based on shifting the perceptions of the races they hate or improving the perceptions of their own. Universities can be just as dangerous as megacorporations, because they are often locked in a competition where name recognition directly correlates to funding. Faculty extractions are com- monplace, especially between the public and pri- vate universities.</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE BIG TEN Mitsuhama Computer Technologies Corporate Court Ranking (2080): 1 Corporate Slogan: “The Future, Brought to You by Mitsuhama” Corporate Status: AAA, public corporation World Headquarters: Kyoto, Japanese Imperial State CEO/President: Toshiro Mitsuhama</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mitsuhama is massive, efficient, and faith- ful to the Japanese Imperial State. Except that last one is not entirely true. No other company has done such a good job of hiding the truth of what goes on inside their boardrooms. It is a credit to the Japanese way of business that the company has stayed so steadfast and silent. However, since their rise to number one, the company has suffered from suc- cess fatigue and the lines of solidarity are beginning to frac- ture. Each of the major shareholders has begun privately sell- ing off stock holdings to unknown parties. Even more ominous, members of the old leadership caste, such as key shareholder Korin Yamana and honorary board advisor Taiga Mitsuhama, have died under mysterious circumstances. Under normal cir- cumstances, change is good. However, change at the top of the Big Ten tends to come with chaos&mdash;and lots of shadowruns.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Saeder-Krupp Corporate Court Ranking (2080): 2 Corporate Slogan: “One Step Beyond” Corporate Status: AAA, private corporation World Headquarters: Neu-Essen, Allied German States CEO/President: Lofwyr</p>
<p class="calibre1">The great dragon Lofwyr harbors a distaste toward fellow Big Ten CEO John- ny Spinrad, the roots of which are too detailed to explain here. Despite a lack of evidence, S-K holds SpinradGlobal at least partially responsible for its recent troubles, which result- ed in a fall from the top spot of the Corporate Court rankings. Lofwyr’s corporation failed to claim the top spot due in part to a series of shadowruns that impacted sales figures in a num- ber of key industrial areas. Even as the corporation is moving to settle that score, Lofwyr is presently at odds with dragon Loremaster Celedyr, presenting S-K with an entirely new set of allies and enemies. S-K is the only corporation bold enough to shun the Mr.&nbsp;Johnson moniker, instead calling their operatives Herr Brackhaus, a strategy that has led runners to know when they are working for S-K and to act accordingly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Renraku Corporate Court Ranking (2080): 3 Corporate Slogan: “Let Us Serve You” Corporate Status: AAA, public corporation World Headquarters: Chiba, Japanese Imperial State CEO/President: Inazo Aneki (Honorary)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Renraku is known for two things: the massive worldwide SIN database, which they maintain, and the Red Samurai. The latter are the elite security forces of the corporation, known by the red samurai (natch) armor they wear. Make no mistake, this isn’t shogun cosplay. If you see a Red Samurai, you’ve wan-</p>
<p class="calibre1">dered into someplace very important to the corporation, and they likely don’t want you to emerge alive. Renraku’s CEO is Inazo Aneki, who 23 used a trinket gifted to him by Dunkel- zahn to step through the impenetrable veil that surrounds Tibet. Aneki never returned and was legally declared dead in ’65. In spite of this, rumors persist that Aneki lives on in spirit form and even ap- pears to members of the board to offer instruction. True or false, Aneki’s seat and vote remain his. Orito Sasaki operates as president, and Shikei Nakatomi chairs the board. The two don’t see eye to eye in terms of Renraku’s plans for the fu- ture. The resultant infighting has kept a lot of shadowrunners in business.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aztechnology Corporate Court Ranking (2080): 4 Corporate Slogan: “For a Better Tomorrow” Corporate Status: AAA, private corporation World Headquarters: Tenochtitlàn, Aztlan CEO/President: Flavia de la Rosa</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some corporations run cities. Aztech- nology owns a country. The corporation evolved from a collaboration of drug car- tel leaders who were treated like folk he- roes in their hometowns. Grandmothers prayed for their safety. Now they pray for the life of Flavia de la Rosa. Aztechnology is a way of life. When the company’s beliefs shift, the beliefs of a nation shift with it. This folk-hero mythos makes Aztechnology extremely dan- gerous on their home turf. Outside of Azzie-land, the company works to build that type of public support with the people and cities with which it interacts. Yet, behind the façade, Aztech- nology is dedicated to two things: growing its brand and ex- panding its land.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shiawase Corporate Court Ranking (2080): 5 Corporate Slogan: “Advancing Life” Corporate Status: AAA, public corporation World Headquarters: Osaka, Japan CEO/President: Tadashi Shiawase</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps the oldest recognized megacorp, Shiawase suffers from the failure of notoriety. The company’s en- ergy production and manufacturing di- visions are household names. However, the company’s other named divisions tra- ditionally underperform when given the Shiawase label. People still don’t expect the company running the power plant to be named after the one serving them su- shi. Disconnected branding led to the company lingering near the bottom of the top ten for years. During the megacorporate audit, Shiawese’s new leadership began to snap up small but popular national and A-rated corporations, rebranding them under the Shiawase name. This lifted the company’s image immediately. As this strategy continues, other larger corpo-</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE POWERS THAT BE // THE LIFE YOU HAVE LEFT</p>
<p class="calibre1">rations are taking notice. In the shadows we know Shiawase for its Marketing Forecasting and Information Division (MFID), a predictive think tank that works to shape the stock market through purchases, rapid sell-offs, and yes, shadowruns. 24 Wuxing Corporate Court Ranking (2080): 6 Corporate Slogan: “We’re Behind Everything You Do” Corporate Status: AAA, public corporation World Headquarters: Hong Kong, Free Enterprise Enclave CEO/President: Sharon Chang-Wu</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon Chang-Wu elevated her company on the spiritual- ist principles of Chinese numerology. That belief system has led to unusual habits. In fact, Wuxing is known to have sabotaged itself once it gained the number-four ranking in order to avoid staying at that level and being closely associated with the number of death in numerology. That brand of mysticism impacts the relationship Wuxing has with shadowrunners. The company is notorious for hiring runners to break into a facility for mundane tasks like moving a chair from one side of the room to the other, thus disrupting the feng shui. When it comes time for payment, expect odd de- nominations whose meanings reflect numerology. Just be careful your fee doesn’t end in a four.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Evo Corporate Court Ranking (2080): 7 Corporate Slogan: “Evo is Acceptance” Corporate Status: AAA, private corporation World Headquarters: Vladivostok, Russia CEO/President: Ysil</p>
<p class="calibre1">Evo was born out of the ashes of the Yamatetsu Corpora- tion. After the eruption of the Ring of Fire in 2061, the corporation named its first metahuman CEO. This move rankled the Japanese rank and file. While Japa- nese citizens could stomach the idea of a manga-esque free spirit named Buttercup owning thirty per- cent of the company, an ork at the helm was just too much. It led other Japanacorps to suggest that Yamatetsu appoint someone more suitable to be the face of the corp. They went the other way, ditching the lockstep philosophy of the Japanacorps and physically moving the HQ to Russia. Evo didn’t only embrace metahuman leadership, They took hold of the idea of evolution itself. Sensing a potential for profit, the company quickly adjusted to the expansion of racial groups. Evo leaned into the change, ultimately leading them down the road of becoming the premier metahuman employer. It was a natural transition then for Evo to accept the Monad culture into the fold. Corps like Evo recognize that the future is posthuman. The rest of us haven’t decided that yet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spinrad Global Corporate Court Ranking (2080): 8 Corporate Slogan: “For a Better Life” Corporate Status: AAA, private corporation World Headquarters: Lisbon, Portugal CEO/President: Johnny Spinrad</p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny Spinrad’s brainchild is the newest edition to the club of ten, having pushed NeoNET off the council once the latter was dismembered by the Corporate Court in the wake of the cognitive frag- mentation disorder scandal. The compa- ny represents a merger between the me- dia-savvy Spinrad Industries and petrochemical giant (along with other activities) Global Sandstorm. SpinGlobal treats attention like currency. Spinrad himself continues to live a publicly cast existence (he has his own channel) whose energy infects the entire company. Likewise, the merger brought at- tention to Sandstorm’s balaclava-clad special security forces, the Nizari.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ares Corporate Court Ranking (2080): 9 Corporate Slogan: “Making the World a Safer Place” Corporate Status: AAA, public corporation World Headquarters: Detroit, UCAS CEO/President: Damien Knight</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ares is the world leader in combat applications. This shows in their own se- curity forces, such as the elite Firewatch Brigade, which came to notoriety during the Chicago Containment. The rank-and- file of Ares security is Knight Errant, a subsidiary that is second only to Lone Star as a worldwide police force. This is notable, because if you’re wanted by KE in one part of the world, then that warrant extends globally. The corporation is in the midst of a massive PR campaign following the Excalibur rifle debacle, where a much-hyped rifle line turned out to be a dud, injuring and killing people who were trying to use it to injure and kill others. In a rare move, they hired another megacorp, Horizon, to help rebrand the corporation. There is plenty of work to go around cleaning up their image. Rumors abound of other diffi- culties behind the scenes, including their longstanding battle with the hideous insect spirits, and the stories say they have explored many paths to ending their troubles. Some of their solutions may well be explosive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Horizon Corporate Court Ranking (2080): 10 Corporate Slogan: “Moving Minds” Corporate Status: AAA, private corporation World Headquarters: Los Angeles, PCC CEO/President: Gary Cline</p>
<p class="calibre1">Horizon is the corporation every teenager wants to work for. Horizon doesn’t sell trends, they create them. You can bet that new trend has been crowdsourced, vetted, deconstructed, re-analyzed, and proofed before being foisted on the public as a spontaneous emergence. The compa- ny can do this because they’re already in people’s heads. Hori- zon is the world leader in social media, so when the sheeple flip on the trid or slot a simsense chip, Horizon is there pro- cessing your habits to determine what they should convince you to like next. Horizon expects to control what you think. It’s in the slogan.</p>

<p class="calibre1">can Koshari, Vory v Zakone, elven Laesa, Seoulpa Rings&mdash;there is no shortage of criminal syndicates to get involved with. Syndicates are street-level per- formers heavily involved in trafficking and protec- tion schemes. They operate in specific geographical turf, and getting involved with a syndicate tends to mean doing work that protects their turf. There is money to be made working for one syndicate versus another, but be careful about forming al- legiances, because once you do, you become the enemy of everyone else in the cesspool. The lowest level of organized crime is the street gangs. These are local organizations usually any- where from ten to one hundred members. Some gangs reach beyond their sprawl, spreading their wings and making a name for themselves. The Cut- ters come to mind, with chapters in multiple cities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Private Individuals Not all running jobs come from organizations. Rich celebrities, so-called immortal elves, philan- thropists, digital lifeforms, and free spirits all might have their own agendas to advance in the shadows. They aren’t as global as corporations, but the problems that impact their lives and cre- ate work opportunities for us are no less danger-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ous. As expected, a bunch of the work you get is bodyguard duty, settling old scores, and suppress- ing information they’d rather not have leak out. However, private sector work can offer the illusion of benefiting the greater good. Many of the jobs I come across are anti-corp or jobs that help out the little guy. I’m sure these employers are playing an angle, but taking a minute to do some good helps offset the all the drek I do for the corps in order to keep the ramen coming.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A Brief History of the Sixth World I’m sure the history lessons from your corpo- rate-funded primary school did a great job of shar- ing the version of history according to whatever corp footed the bill. There is nothing wrong with that. Everyone tells the same story about the big moments. What is lost are the connective fibers between those moments. History is the timeline sprinting backward from where you are right now, zigging and zagging between those huge data- points. If you’re here reading this, then where you are now is in the shadows. There is no corporation shelling out cash to turn this into the history they</p>

<p class="calibre1">want. In spite of the specific circumstances that led you here, there are certain inexorable occur- rences that made it certain that you had no oth- 26 er choice than to become a runner. If you’re with the church set you might think all of this is God’s plan&mdash;whichever God you subscribe to, of course. These aren’t necessarily in chronological order. In our lifetimes, a lot of bad drek tends to happen all at once, and only after we’ve sifted through the wreckage do we start to approach the idea of what came first and how it all affects us. This world is harsh and unfriendly, but it also makes a drekload of sense. You pull on the right threads, you can trace where your life is now all the way back to the beginning. It all started with a plague.</p>
<p class="calibre1">VITAS and UGE Virally induced toxic allergy syndrome (VI- TAS) hit the world in two waves. The first emer- gence of the disease was in 2010 in a crowded corner of New Delhi. The disease caught like dry kindling and spread across the planet. By 2011, one out of every four people on the planet was dead or dying from the disease. The hardest hit were the densest world populations of China, Bahrain, and Bangladesh. Mexico was the first government to collapse under the weight of the disease. Its citizens predictably fled north toward the promise of medical care. What happened next is still the subject of spec- ulation. Unexplained genetic expression (UGE) touched ten percent of the remaining population. Children were being born with significant physi- ological differences from so-called normal kids. The media quickly classified these changes into catchy categories with names borrowed from pop- ular fantasy: dwarf and elf. Soon after, the phe- nomenon called Goblinization introduced orks and trolls. Like VITAS, there wasn’t a person on the planet who didn’t know someone affected by these changes. The new meta-racial emersion knew no class. They try to make it seem otherwise now, but the elves weren’t all born to wealthy parents, and the trolls and orks weren’t all dumped into the slums. My father was born to a wealthy Texas-oil family, and they hid him from the public because he was born an ork. Goblinization sparked fears that this was a side effect or even the next wave of VITAS, but that wave was still to come. It hit in early 2022 and resulted in the death of another ten percent of the remaining population. None of the emerging metaraces were spared. However, VITAS helped us metahumans because it allowed the research to be done to prove that goblinization was not a side effect or infection path of VITAS. Doctors discovered that UGE was not even a disease in and of itself. UGE was the genuine emergence</p>
<p class="calibre1">of new races. We’d learn soon enough that those myths and legends that inspired the names of those races had a basis in reality. But before we could set about to working together, the pope gave a speech that stopped just short of justifying the murder of metahuman children. What it did was announce that it was okay to hate metas, and that hate came fast and hot. Ayatollah Hamidullah of Iran declared jihad against metahumanity, only to have the great dragon Aden declare war on the ayatollah, and win it forcefully. That didn’t stop the spread of hate, and hate groups formed in every nation. Some continued to blame VITAS on metahumans even though they had zero evidence. Sometimes people said that tensions between metatypes overwhelmed tensions based on skin color, but it’s not so simple. Those old tensions didn’t flame out. The arrival of the new races was more like throwing napalm on a forest fire. Sud- denly everyone had an “other” to be mad at, and terrifyingly fewer of “their own” that they needed to protect. A second wave of UGE called SURGE struck with the return of Halley’s Comet in 2061, setting off a new wave of racism as more meta variants poured into our world. It proved once and for all that UGE was unrelated to VITAS&mdash;not that the true deniers even cared. Being so far removed from that plague, it’s hard to think about what losing one out of four people globally actually did to society. Above all else it created a power vacuum that the corporate world was in the best position to fill.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dawn of the Megas The bottom line about the corps is this: They run the world. It wasn’t always this way. It took the birth of extraterritoriality to push us kicking and screaming into this new reality. We have Shi- awase to thank for that. The 2007 Shiawase deci- sion opened the floodgates to corporate overreach. The U.S. Supreme Court ruling leaned heavily on the argument that corporations were beholden to customers, not governments. Government interfer- ence stood in the way of a company’s ability to serve its customers. Corporate overreach was inevitable from that point. With many restraints falling by the way- side, owners and shareholders started demanding ever-more rapid growth, without ever stopping to ask whether their demands were realistic. They re- sponded by exploring new avenues of growth, one of the quickest being acquisitions. They merged and acquisitioned their asses off, growing larger and larger until the system that ensured fair com- petition bent and finally broke. Eventually, the U.S. ratified the Business Recognition Accords (BRA), moving to treat specific corporations as sovereign entities, conferring to them the recognition and re- sulting powers of a nation. Other governments fol-</p>

<p class="calibre1">jackpoint The shadowrunner network called JackPoint was born out of a need to speak truth. After a time, it became more than a place to connect&mdash;it was also a way to navigate the truth of the Sixth World and remind you of the history the powers-that-be would rather you forgot. A place to check in and see what remains of the life you have left.</p>
<p class="calibre1">lowed suit. Today, extraterritoriality is recognized by most standing governments. The ones that re- fuse face pressure to cave. After the BRA, diversified conglomerates squeezed every market until the idea of mom-and- pop industries didn’t exist. That commlink you bought? Mitsuhama. Its cheaper off-brand com- petitor? Also Mitsuhama. The artisan-designed commlink with the bells and whistles from a small independent you’ve never heard of? You guessed it: Mitsuhama. Everything became a conglomerate, and the idea of choice breeding competition be- came a piece of history. Even the American dream shifted. Individuals no longer started businesses to run them, but instead to be bought out by larger corps and cash in. That would be fine, maybe, if not for the loss of rights that came with this new reality. Empow- ered by their size, megacorporations argued that civil-rights laws worked to actively disadvantage the corporations in terms of hiring and promotion practices. They made it seem that the goal of civil rights was to hinder corporations by forcing them to hire employees according to a universal set of rules that did not reflect the culture or goals of the corporation. Laws once designed to criminalize race or poverty were re-legislated to actively work against worker rights. Wage slavery was born. Today’s corporate world is a lot like the high- school lunchroom of your nightmares. Corps buy up other corps to protect their rating&mdash;their seat at the table, and everyone wants a seat at the table. The higher up you go, the smaller and more exclu- sive the table gets. There are ten kids at the head table. Together, they form the Corporate Court. When the Corporate Court first started, there were only seven members: Ares, BMW, JRJ, Keruba, Mistuhama, Shiawase, and ORO. If you hold the core ownership of one of these seven, you get a seat on the Corporate Court, guaranteed. These corps came together to form the rating system that determines extraterritoriality. The corporate rating system is a complex series of checks and balances, but all that really matters are the three ratings at the top. A-ranked corpora- tions are those that have amassed enough assets to extend across multiple nations, though they don’t have to be fully diversified in their business lines. It takes AA status to get you extraterritorial status, and the Court guards that entry like a watchdog.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Being part of the exclusive AA group isn’t a per- manent thing. Corporations are subject to random audits to determine if their assets still meet the re- quirements of AA status. AAA ratings are reserved for the corps that have a seat on the Corporate Court. The order of the ten changes from time to time, but it takes a catastrophic change to lose your seat entirely. This is what happened to Neo- NET. The breaking up of the company came from a lot of sources, including Court edicts, but you cannot ignore the role of the shadows in bringing their role in cognitive fragmentation disorder to light and then helping some hostile takeovers of some of their assets. In the end, shadowrunners helped push NeoNET out of their seat. Who is the next Big Ten to tumble? You may find yourself in a position to play a role in that. As a result of corporate sovereignty, the world went from having just shy of two hundred countries to having half as many AA-rated and AAA-rated corporations, each with its own extra- territoriality, right to print its own currency, and standing army. Corporations gained the power to challenge and even take over nations. Prior to VI- TAS, nations were the shells corporations gestated in. When the Mexican government collapsed in 2015, a new way of corporate thinking was born. A group of drug cartels quickly organized to form ORO, which would eventually come to be known as Aztechnology. ORO became the first corpora- tion to seize control of a nation. Parts of the Native American Nations understood that the new world order wasn’t just a matter of power but of corpo- rate leverage. A collection of tribes formed and in- corporated the Pueblo Corporate Council. Because the corps were so influential in keeping the world running during the troubles, nobody spent much time worrying about the problems with extrater- ritoriality. By the time anyone did, it was too late.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Crash of ’29 You could argue that the history of the Sixth World can be traced along the transaction history of a company called Fuchi and its ugly roller coaster ride to become NeoNET. That story begins with the Matrix Crash of 2029. At that point, the network that had been called the internet was ubiquitous. It was also completely unprotected. The Crash virus overwhelmed the network instantly. Cars stopped dead on the road, the banks went dark, and the vi- rus brought global chaos as it spread. Our world, barely recovering from the trauma of UGE, was code-deep in a new nightmare. The American government commissioned a team called Echo Mirage to use elite hacking tools known as cyberdecks to enter the grid and con- front the virus before it could destroy any more of the network infrastructure. Make no mistake, Echo Mirage was the birth of shadowrunning. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE LIFE YOU HAVE LEFT // A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SIXTH WORLD</p>
<p class="calibre1">thirty-two people sent into the net to face nascent black IC were an expendable black ops team. They knew it. Seven people survived the run. Four of those seven immediately dropped off the grid and used the payday they scored to create new lives for themselves. Some remained in the shadows and are the reason JackPoint exists. Two others used their newly found expertise to form Fuchi Indus- trial Electronics. The Crash broke the world. Governments, cash, resources, and data starved, and alliances and part- nerships broke, shifted, and were newly built, fur- ther redrawing the global map of power. Beyond the physical repercussions, the Crash also revealed a truth we’d long feared: artificial intelligences (AIs) stalked the matrix. They would remain out of play for the moment, but not forever.</p>

Now imagine them taking the form of spirits and manifesting on our plane of exis- tence in bodies the size of a car. It sounds like a horror movie. It also sounds like a damn power- ful military asset. Nobody really blames Ares for trying to militarize bugs. We just blame them for screwing it up. The nightmare of Bug City can be traced back to an NGO called the Universal Brother- hood (UB). The organization billed itself as be- ing “dedicated to bettering the quality of life for all people.” Predictably, they set themselves up in the inner cities where the people had no hope and no economic voice. The UB, as it turned out, was a front for the bugs. The organization was collecting people to use as hosts for bug spirits. They set up hives all over the world in prepara- tion for a bug invasion. Ares had some knowl- edge of what was going on and had set up mon- itoring on one of these hives in Chicago. They allowed the UB operation to continue until they realized it was much larger than they could han- dle. Things escalated with mind-warping speed. The military joined the fight and Chicago was walled off, trapping thousands of citizens inside the Containment Zone. The area strangled Chi- cago’s economic development. One thing we know about bugs is they don’t ever pop up where we want them to. Another thing we know is that once they’ve taken root, nothing short of a nuke will get them out. Ares tested that theory, setting off a tactical nuke inside the Chi- cago Containment Zone. It wasn’t enough. The blast destroyed a large population of the bugs, but enough remained to keep Chicago walled off for another decade while the UCAS military worked to cull the insects. The city has been open for a few years now, but the bug problem is not solved. Far</p>
<p class="calibre1">from it, in fact. Try to get bugs out of one place, and they pop up somewhere else. The bug threat isn’t gone or even forgotten&mdash;far from it. Everyone holds Ares responsible for the situation as it is, and 29 the corporation knows they need to do something in order to save face, and maybe deliver a decisive blow to the bugs. Of course, in the Sixth World, no problem stays one thing for very long. I mean, why be one thing when you can be a whole clusterfrag of nightmares? The Containment Zone holds more than just bug spirits. Creatures infected with var- ious strains of the human-metahuman vampiric virus (HMHVV) haunt the ruins, stalking the living and waiting for a chance to feed on them. There are parts of the Containment Zone like the Shattergraves, the ruins of the Sears Tower, where ghouls far outnumber the living, which means accidentally wandering into the wrong area means you quickly shift from living being to lunch. While the Infected make many people nervous&mdash;and for good reasons&mdash;many of them simply want to find a way to live in this world, just like everyone else, and some of them have found a home in the shadows.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crash 2.0 When Renraku’s flagship Seattle Arcology went completely offline in 2059, it marked the start of a five-year saga that would change the Matrix as we know it. We know now that the trouble began when a rogue AI named Deus seized control of the facility. The Renraku corporation kept this in the dark, first, sending in their own security and then shadowrunners to figure out what was happening inside. Over the next few years the AI worked its plan. Finally, in 2064 a series of well-timed and well placed EMP explosions, a dissonance worm, and Deus’ attempted ascension all colluded to crash the Matrix. The damage knocked everything offline. As with VITAS before it, the corps were right there to pick up the pieces and turn a tidy profit. Remember when I said the Sixth World could be traced through Fuchi? Well, that company morphed into NeoNET. Guess who stepped in to pick up the pieces of itself and the Matrix? Infused with new money and technology from Transys Neuronet, they took the lead in insti- tuting the Wireless Matrix Initiative, rebuilding the Matrix into the augmented reality wonder- land that it is now. In the wake of the crash, the Grid Overwatch Division, GOD for short, was established to regulate the Matrix. They claimed it was a mechanism to prevent one corporation from controlling the network, but the reality is that it exists to police independents like myself and to track and capture Matrix anomalies that rise out of the Resonance pools.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SIXTH WORLD // THE LIFE YOU HAVE LEFT</p>
<p class="calibre1">The CFD Crisis Lessons learned from VITAS and the Chicago Containment were put to the test when cognitive fragmentation disorder (CFD) was uncovered in the early 2070s. CFD is a digitally transmitted con- dition that propagates from nanotech hives and geneware, making anyone wired with that type of tech vulnerable. Basically, infected nanites interact with a host brain, and the personality of the victim is overwritten with that of an AI. At the beginning of the crisis, we called the victims head cases. They walked and talked like the people we know and love, but it wasn’t them at the wheel. The infected called themselves Monads, a throwback to hacker coding language. At the height of the crisis, the CFD-infected dragon Eliohann (long story) attacked NeoNET’s Boston HQ but was repelled by a combination of corporate and military forces. The dragon’s arrival marked the start of a CFD outbreak in the city. The Corporate Court Crisis Coordination Committee (C5) sprang into action, swiftly locking down Bos- ton both physically and in the Matrix. Corp-op- erated clinics popped up everywhere the megas had a presence and offered free screening for CFD. On the surface, the corps worked to localize all instances of the outbreak. However, a secondary purpose was to gather all of the CFD-infected pa- tients they could and attempt to control the virus. We hadn’t yet learned our lesson from Ares bug failures. Nearly every megacorporation took in Monads. AA-rated Mangadyne initiated Project Monad amidst a sweet-smelling PR cloud. Several different attempts at a cure have been made, with the best results coming when the Monad is willing to leave the host. Evo’s Mars Base Gagarin hosts the largest re- maining population of Monads. However, many of them loaded themselves into the Deep Space Ex- ploration and Colonization I (DSECI) and depart- ed for parts unknown. While Evo took on the pub- lic burden of the Monads crisis, behind the scenes all fingers pointed at NeoNET. The corporation took heavy losses in the form of lives and assets until it lost its AAA status.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Megacorporate Audit Corporate conflicts happen behind closed boardroom doors. When the conflicts spill out onto the streets, the battles are waged by shadowrun- ners so that the businessmen don’t have to get their hands dirty. However, when something big enough to capture public attention happens, fallout is inev- itable. The CFD crisis caused deep fissures within NeoNET, especially at the top where the Villiers family found themselves at odds with key share- holder (and dragon&mdash;they’re everywhere) Celedyr. That conflict created enough of an opening for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny Spinrad to leverage his personal fortune to merge with AA megacorp Global Sandstorm and turn Spinrad Industries into Spinrad Global. His corp fought for and won a seat on the Corporate Court. Spinrad’s gambit upset the balance at the top, reminding other members of the Corporate Court that their spot at the most exclusive club in the world is not permanent. Though to be fair, most of them were not upset to see NeoNET go and played a strong role in pushing them out the door. There is this old saying, the more things change … the more we try to put everything back to nor- mal. The new normal started with a vote. Evo’s representative pushed for a review of the rank- ing standards for A and AA corporations. All of the judges agreed, so the measure was backed by each member of the Big Ten. The new standards fundamentally shifted the requirements for what it meant to be a megacorporation while strength- ening the requirements for admission to AA status. If the goal was to convince A and AA corpora- tions to cannibalize themselves, then mission ac- complished. The court’s ruling sparked a war that continues to flame to this day. The shifting dynamics of AA admission meant that corps who survived by being just good enough in a lot of different markets no longer received the same ranking as corps that specialized in a specific field and pushed ground- breaking innovations. Information itself became a living thing, crowd-sourced, collated, and weapon- ized in order to determine who was and wasn’t wor- thy of extraterritoriality. Where there is corporate war, there is work for people like us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The World We Have Left A few things stuck from the world before. For starters, climate change still contributes to famine and starvation across the globe, sped by the effects of the Great Ghost Dance and later the Ring of Fire eruptions that marked the arrival of Halley’s Comet. Racism is an ongoing threat, and in the Sixth World the choices of who to hate are great- ly expanded. Economic disparity is at an all-time high (take that, feudalism!), with those not behold- en to a corporation constantly fighting to make ends meet. Of course, there is profit in poverty, so there are corporations actively working to main- tain the imbalance. Today’s world is a weird space of distributed cognition where everything and anything is possi- ble, and the virtual self has as much value as the meat body. Where the meat body feels like the cage holding you back, whether it be from speeding through the Matrix or navigating the metaplanes. Still, the meat body must reside someplace. Where</p>

<p class="calibre1">you live impacts everything from the brands of food you eat to the type of work you get in the shadows. Pay attention, because if you’re going to work the local streets, you ought to know what kind of drek you’re stepping in to.</p>
<p class="calibre1">North America The United States of America, the land of the free, home of the brave doesn’t exist anymore. It ate itself. What remains are scattered clumps of nations parsed by city-states. Much of the north belongs to the United Canadian Ameri- can States (UCAS), which came together in the wake of the treaty of Denver. The UCAS seat of government is still DeeCee, but the real pow- er is spread among the cities of Boston (where what’s left of NeoNET makes its home) and De- troit (the world headquarters of Ares). Perhaps the most important city in the UCAS is Seattle, though, because it is the corporate equivalent of a demilitarized zone. Each of the Big Ten and several AAs maintain a serious corporate pres- ence here. Their citizens live in close proximity, mingling in the streets and exchanging digital handshakes. When corporate conflicts start, they usually start on the streets of Seattle. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">size of the city, the wealth available, and the corporate and geopolitical conflicts that take place there have made it the capital of the shad- owrunning world. South of the UCAS is the Confederation of American States (CAS). This nation is the result of old alliances kept up through hundreds of years of American turmoil. The South rose again, and it gave us Lone Star, the world’s largest private police force. If you’ve done any serious time behind bars or plan to, you’ll find yourself in the CAS, where dried-up oil fields and seaside rigs have been repur- posed as high-occupancy detention facilities. The rest of North America is split between the Native American tribes and a growing nation of elves. Tír Tairngire covers much of what exists between Mt. Shasta and Mt. Hood. The elven lands are bordered by the California Free State, Salish-Shidhe Council, and the Pueblo Corporate Council. The Tsimshian Protectorate, Algonki- an-Manitou Council, Québec, and the Sioux Na- tion cover most of the rest of the land that is part North America. Denver sits in the middle of every- thing, a lone independent city (no one would call it “free”) under the protection of Ghostwalker and filled to capacity with spies from every nation on the continent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE WORLD WE HAVE LEFT // THE LIFE YOU HAVE LEFT</p>
<p class="calibre1">South America The South American conversation is dominated by just one word: Amazonia. The nation emanci- pated itself from the world at the start of the Awak- ening. Three great dragons assumed control, but only Hualpa remains as a visible leader. Amazonia covers all of what was Brazil and is home of the largest rainforest in the world. It remains among a shrinking number of nations where corporations do not exercise extraterritoriality. Because of that, they come to blows with Aztlan on a nearly annual basis. Many other top corporations seek to gain a foothold down south and uncover whatever se- crets the Awakened jungle holds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aztlan and Central America Aztlan rules the land, stretching from what was Mexico and parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas down through Colombia. The rule is not un- questioned. Border skirmishes with Yucatan and Amazonia are a daily fact of life. The tensions with its neighbors offer shadowrunners a steady supply of opportunities as smugglers. At the heart of the na- tion, Aztlan is an ideological corporate society try- ing to recreate the majesty of the old Aztec empire. Aztlan never seems to be happy with the limitations of its borders. As the number of Aztechnology citi- zens rises, the drumbeats of war grow louder. In the nearby Caribbean League, pirates roam the sea, spurred by a lack of viable work. Inter- national waters remain a hotbed of piracy and smuggling thanks to the high volume of ships mov- ing from nation to nation and through the recon- structed Panama Canal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Africa The second-largest continent is a hotbed of polit- ical dividedness. The ghoul kingdom of Asamando is facing mounting pressures to illegalize the flesh trade. However, since ninety percent of the popula- tion is infected with HMHVV, coming in line with humanitarian wishes would decimate their food supply. A steady market for slavers and smugglers will remain until science comes up with another way for ghouls to feed. To the south, the Azanian Confederation is a major power, and Egypt, Kenya, the Ethiomalian Territories, and Algeria also hold considerable sway. The Kingdoms of Nigeria and Congo Tribal Lands are more loosely organized, which partly means people find more opportunities to live free of corporate control in these spots.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe Europe is a patchwork of ancient kingdoms try- ing to gain a foothold in the modern age. There</p>
<p class="calibre1">are more kings and queens scattered across the continent than anywhere else in the world. From deep within Tír na nÓg, the Seelie Court grasps for control over the mystical elements of the land. The United Kingdom is still coming to grips with the reemergence of Lyonesse, an island that mag- ically appeared at the intersection of powerful ley lines, and what that means for their future. In the midst of all of this old-world magic, Lofwyr has transformed Neu-Essen in the Allied German States into one of the world’s largest sprawls, while Lisbon in Portugal is the home of Spinrad Global, the newest AAA-rated corporation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Asia The key to this continent is a series of islands just off the mainland&mdash;the Japanese Imperial State. Neo-Tokyo rivals Seattle for its symbolic role as a runner’s haven. The city boasts the larg- est economy in the world, and each of the Big Ten and several AA corporations on the verge main- tain a presence in the districts. The emperor’s gov- ernment and the corps represent the In and Yo of the nation. It is a balance fraught with turmoil, leaving a lot of space for runners to scratch out an existence. Just off the coast of Japan, Yomi Island is home to a number of malevolent spirits who feed off the pain and suffering of past racial atrocities. The as- tral space around the island is particularly strong, attracting many paranormal researchers and mis- ery tourists who are always in need of security. Shaanxi hosts another tourist curiosity. The Great Wall appears on the astral plane as an im- penetrable barrier manned by spirits that resem- ble ancient Chinese soldiers. The mystery of these guardians has attracted the world’s top academic thaumaturgists, but so far no one has a concrete idea of how the guardians were summoned or even what they are protecting. Nearby Manchuria is best known for an Awakened population that in- cludes a mixture of spirits of the people and invis- ible trickster spirits known collectively as Ta’ren. Shangui Corporation is the largest in the country, having achieved extraterritoriality, a right reserved for businesses owned by Manchurian citizens. Like Evo, its primary shareholder is a free spirit. That similarity has led to strong ties between Shangui and Evo. Russia is home to Evo, making the city of Vladivostok one of the most advanced cities in the world. However, just a few miles beyond the sprawl, conditions are practically medieval. The sharp contrasts between the haves and have-nots in Russia create an enormous market for the Vory. The Indian Union is home to a huge chunk of the world’s populations and has hugely significant entertainment industries, financial powerhouses, and magical sites. Its growing wealth and power</p>

Sao- tome Aquadomes litter the bottom of the sea near Australia and New Guinea. Corporations like Pro- teus AG and Evo started up a tech war over so- called blue technology designed to help humanity reach and survive at pressure depths that weren’t meant for us. If there is anything about sentient life you can count on, it’s that it is going to go where it isn’t supposed to. The Atlantean Foundation has built an orga- nization around going where you shouldn’t. The organization is in fierce competition with more economically minded corporate competitors to tap the secrets of the Australian Republic’s unusual ge- ology. The vast red dust wasteland known as the Awakened Outback is practically inhospitable to metahumans. Roving mana storms mask the in- credible wildlife and fauna that has come to popu- late the “Big Red” since the Awakening. A cottage industry of poachers has sprung up in Brisbane, hoping to strike it rich.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Space Since NASA first stepped foot on the moon, space has held the promise of commercial explora- tion. Today there are a handful of launch sites ca- pable of getting you to low earth orbit (LEO). The Hong Kong Space Port and Space City in Alabama remain the only public gateways to life among the stars. With the departure of DSECI from Evo’s Gagarin Mars base and plans already underway for DSECII and III, space is open for business. Closer to earth, vacationers can enjoy a stay at Shibanokuji Free Fall. The station is one of more than fifty manned facilities currently in LEO. Most notable among them is the Zurich Orbital Habi- tat, home to the Corporate Court. From LEO it is a short ride to the moon or any one of her lunar LaGrange points, where a number of top-secret re- search facilities are waiting to be discovered.</p>

<p class="calibre1">WHAT’S NEXT // THE LIFE YOU HAVE LEFT</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shadowrun is a game of pitting a team of skilled outsiders up against the vast array of challenges the setting will throw at them. The players usually have a job to do; the game is about their creativity in designing a plan to do it, then trying to pull off that plan without it going too far wrong. The rules of Shadowrun are built around a few core essentials, namely that you should be throwing nice handfuls of D6s to see what happens, and cha- os is always lurking nearby. These rules exist to help contain and direct the chaos&mdash;but not fully control it, because who has full control over what the dice do? To look at how the game works, let’s knock out a few basics first.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What are primary roles in the game? There are two main roles: player and gamemas- ter. The players have a character they represent in the game (the player character, or PC). They are</p>
<p class="calibre1">the ones who have adventures, going out and tak- ing on shadowrun jobs and using the skills they have to succeed. Hopefully. And not die. Anyway, the gamemaster helps the story move along by set- ting up the framework, controlling a number of characters (referred to as non-player characters, or NPCs) the player characters encounter and inter- act with. The gamemaster keeps the story moving, providing the incentives and opposition that make the player characters’ lives interesting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">How do the players and the gamemaster work together? The goal of a role-playing game is to use the play- ers, gamemaster, and dice to tell a story with unex- pected twists and drama. The gamemaster is there to help the players see the story unfold, and the dice are there to provide randomness&mdash;sometimes the runners will succeed by the skin of their teeth, sometimes they’ll fail and need to scramble to make up for it, and sometimes they’ll succeed so hard that</p>
<p class="calibre1">GAME CONCEPTS //</p>
<p class="calibre1">people will be talking about what they pulled off for years afterward. All of these elements can be part of a memorable game, so it’s the job of everyone playing the game to make the unfolding plot fun and memo- rable. Games tend to work best when everyone looks out for the fun of the group, rather than advancing their goals at the cost of everyone else’s. The Run- ning the Game chapter has more thoughts on how the gamemaster can build plots and create an envi- ronment enjoyable for everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What happens during a Shadowrun game? Lots of mayhem! Briefly, the player characters work as a team and get hired by Mr.&nbsp;Johnson (the pseudonym used by people contracting runs), scope out the job, do the legwork, and then car- ry out their plan. Depending on the complexity of the job, it may cover multiple gaming sessions. The way they pull off the run, the people they help, and the people they hurt can set the stage for future missions and plot developments. As a game session progresses, players will meet obstacles or have the chance to use their skills to carry out their plan. This is when the dice come out!</p>
<p class="calibre1">What dice do I use? Six-sided dice. Period. Sometimes one or two or three, sometimes a small handful, sometimes a large handful. Maybe twenty or more, when you get really good. Throughout the book, six-sid- ed dice are abbreviated as D6, sometimes with a number in front telling you how many dice, so that “3D6” means three six-sided dice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Do I want to roll high or low? High. Most of the time, you are not totaling the dice rolls. Instead, you are counting up the number of 5s and 6s you rolled. These are referred to as hits. You also want to see how many 1s you got.</p>
<p class="calibre1">gether&mdash;that’s how many dice you roll. Some rolls will simply add two attributes, or will count the same attribute twice. Now, of course, there are changes and modifiers 35 based on a variety of circumstances. That’s why we have this whole book! But if you remember this basic way of making dice pools, you’ll know what to do in most circumstances.</p>
<p class="calibre1">How do I use the dice pool rolls to know if I succeeded or not? Excellent question! To discuss that, we have to talk about tests. So we’ll do that now!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tests In a Shadowrun game, you will at some point attempt something that either other people, the laws of the universe, or both do not want you to accomplish. To see if you succeeded or not, you’ll need to perform a test, where you generate a dice pool, roll to get a result, and then see if you suc- ceeded. There are three basic types of tests: Simple, Opposed, and Extended.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simple Tests In a Simple test, you roll your dice pool, count your hits, and see if you meet or beat a threshold of hits established by the gamemaster. The gamemas- ter establishes the threshold based on the Threshold Guidelines table and suggestions and guidelines es- tablished within the rules. If the hits are equal to or greater than the threshold, the action succeeds; in some occasions, the number of net hits (the number of hits above the threshold) comes into play. A Simple test is written like this: Outdoors + Intuition (3) test</p>
<p class="calibre1">If more than half of the dice you rolled are 1s, you have a glitch or critical glitch; see p.&nbsp;44 for more info. If you got more hits than you need to suc- ceed in a test, the hits above the minimum amount</p>
<p class="calibre1">SKILL LINKED ATTRIBUTE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Opposed Tests</p>
<p class="calibre1">THRESHOLD</p>
<p class="calibre1">needed to succeed are called net hits. On some occasions (notably Initiative; see p.&nbsp;39), you will add the total of the numbers rolled together instead of counting hits. On those occa- sions, higher remains better.</p>
<p class="calibre1">How do I know how many dice to roll? The number of dice you roll is called a dice pool. To make it, you generally look at a skill (p. 39) and a linked attribute (p.&nbsp;37). Both of those have numerical values. Add those two numbers to-</p>
<p class="calibre1">In an Opposed test, another character, object, device, or entity is actively (or passively) resist- ing your efforts, so you must exceed their effort to succeed. In an Opposed test, two parties roll dice pools and compare the number of hits. The one with the most hits wins. Ties typically go to the aggressor, though this may change if net hits are required to make a given effect. The difference between the higher number of hits and the lower number of hits are the net hits in these tests, and they are often applied to the action in some way&mdash; for example, in combat, net hits from the attacker are added to the Damage Value of their attack.</p>
<p class="calibre1">TESTS // GAME CONCEPTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">An Opposed test is written like this: Stealth + Agility vs.&nbsp;Perception + Intuition 36</p>
<p class="calibre1">Teamwork Tests Teamwork tests are a little different from the other tests, in that they complement another test.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Acting player’s skill and attribute</p>
<p class="calibre1">Defending player’s skill and attribute</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shadowrunners function as a team, so Teamwork tests give them a chance to help each other out. To perform a Teamwork test, select one per-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Extended Tests Simple and Opposed tests involve actions that are taken and resolved quickly, generally in the course of a few seconds. Extended tests take longer and are for more complicated activities, like repair- ing an automobile or building a backdoor into a Matrix host. Extended tests have a dice pool and a threshold like Simple tests, but the threshold does not have to be met on a single roll (and often can’t be). The player can make multiple rolls of the dice pool, progressively making the dice pool 1 die small- er each time they roll, until they have accumulated enough hits (totaling the hits from all their rolls) to meet or beat the threshold (or run out of dice and fail). With each roll, a certain amount of time pass- es. This time is known as the interval, and it is listed as part of each Extended test. Setting an interval can be done with the Interval Scale table (p.&nbsp;312). An Extended test looks like this:</p>
<p class="calibre1">LINKED SKILL ATTRIBUTE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Engineering + Logic (9, 1 hour) test</p>
<p class="calibre1">son as the leader; anyone else involved is a help- er. They all roll the same test&mdash;namely, whatever test they’re trying to pull off together. So if they’re working together to repair the team’s Bulldog Step- Van, then they all roll an Engineering + Logic test. The helpers roll first; any hits become extra dice added to the leader’s dice pool. The total amount of dice added by all helpers cannot be greater than the leader’s applicable skill rank (or the higher of the attributes, if it’s a test involving two attributes). A glitch on a roll by a helper should cause sig- nificant distraction to the next action or few ac- tions they take, preventing them from gaining or spending Edge for one to three combat rounds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Teamwork Tests in Initiative To assist another member of your team while acting in Initiative order (see p.&nbsp;39), you have to declare your assistance before they act and while you still have a Major Action to use. The Assist Major Action is used to become a helper on a Teamwork test. The leader must perform their part of the test the next time they have a</p>
<p class="calibre1">THRESHOLD</p>
<p class="calibre1">THRESHOLD GUIDELINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">INTERVAL</p>
<p class="calibre1">combat round. If they take actions without doing their part of the Teamwork test, or if they defer their actions, the extra dice from the helpers are lost. They can start the process over again if they would like on their next turn.</p>
<ol class="calibre2">
<li class="calibre3">Simple task, only slightly more difficult than walk- ing and talking. Shooting at a nearby building.</li>
<li class="calibre3">More complex, but still in the range of normal ex- perience. A task an average person pulls of regularly. Shooting at a nearby building while running.</li>
<li class="calibre3">Normal starting point for Simple tests. Complicated enough to require skill. Shadowrunners are expected to be more competent than normal people, which is why game thresholds are based here. Shooting a window out of a nearby building.</li>
<li class="calibre3">More difficult, impressive enough to accomplish. Shooting an enemy in the window of a nearby building.</li>
<li class="calibre3">Tricky, the sort of thing only accomplished by those who have worked on their skills. Shooting an enemy in the window of a nearby buiding at minimum range.</li>
<li class="calibre3">Elite-level accomplishment, something that few in the world could pull off with any degree of regular- ity. Shooting an enemy in the window of a building at far range.</li>
<li class="calibre3">Standing out among the elite, demonstrating very rare ability. Shooting an enemy in the window of a building at far range while running.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre1">Buying Hits Sometimes a player does not want to trust the vagaries of the dice, and they feel that they have a large enough dice pool and an easy enough task that they can buy hits instead of rolling dice. To buy hits, you form your dice pool and calculate one hit for every four dice, rounded down. This is an all- or-nothing move&mdash;you either buy hits with all your dice or with none. Edge cannot be used in any way when buying hits, and you need gamemaster ap- proval to buy hits. It should not happen in a circum- stance where a glitch or critical glitch would have a significant impact on the test’s outcome.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trying Again Sometimes you roll the dice and they don’t do what you want them to do. Stupid dice. Anyway, the natural inclination is to try again, as long as the cops aren’t chasing you or gangers aren’t shooting at you or whatever. That’s allowed, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">GAME CONCEPTS // TESTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">retrying a test when circumstances have not changed imposes a &ndash;2 dice pool penalty on the character. Each addition- al attempt imposes another &ndash;2 penalty. 37 Taking a significant break (the game- master decides what definition of “sig- nificant” applies) resets the dice pool. This penalty does not apply to Com- bat actions, as each attack is considered a new and separate action, not a retry.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Character Traits The test listing mentioned skills and attributes of player characters, which are two of the key traits of characters in Shadowrun. We’ll run those down, along with other critical aspects of characters, in this section.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Attributes These are the core stats for a charac- ter. They encompass the abilities char- acters were born with and developed through hard work, the tools they com- bine with individual skills to accomplish tasks. More details about attributes, in- cluding the ranges for Attribute ranks, can be found in the Character Creation chapter (p.&nbsp;58). Attributes come in three groups: Physical, Mental, and Special. Various things modify attributes, such as spells and gear, but a character’s adjusted attribute can never be higher than their current attribute rank +4.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Physical The Physical attributes are:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Body This represents the general sturdiness, integrity, and health of the individual. It sometimes is correlated to size&mdash;trolls (see p.&nbsp;56) tend to have high Body rat- ings&mdash;but this is not a perfect correla- tion, as dwarfs tend to have higher Body ratings than humans. Body’s uses include resisting damage and toxins.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Agility This represents nimbleness, speed, flexibility, and hand-eye coordination. It is the key attribute for combat, as well as many athletic activities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHARACTER TRAITS // GAME CONCEPTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reaction While Agility may be speed, Reaction is quick- ness, the ability to respond with alacrity. Reaction is one of the key defensive attributes, and it is also used in piloting and controlling vehicles and drones.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Strength This is raw muscle power, the ability to lift, carry, and punch with great force. It comes up in some Athletics tests and is important in unarmed combat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mental Attributes The Mental attributes are:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Willpower This represents the character’s ability to perse- vere through hardship, pushing through pain, de- ception, and many other obstacles the Sixth World throws at them. It is very important for magic-based characters, who use it to maintain their energy through the work of channeling mana, and it also is important for resisting some attacks and illusions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Logic This is the coldly calculating part of the mind, the rational, analytical, puzzle-solving aspect. Deckers and technomancers use it frequently, and it can be useful to anyone in pattern recognition and other tasks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Intuition The yin to Logic’s yang (or, probably, the oth- er way around), Intuition is your gut instinct, your sudden inspiration, your flash of insight that doesn’t seem to make any sense but still works. Intuition helps characters react to danger, perceive</p>
<p class="calibre1">rance of danger and good sense that lets shadowrun- ners survive where others do not. Edge is detailed and important enough to have its own section (p.&nbsp;44).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic Not all characters have this attribute; it is only for magic-using characters, who are generally referred to as Awakened characters. It measures their strength in channeling mana into spectacular effects.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Resonance Like Magic, not all characters have this attri- bute&mdash;it is exclusive to technomancers, characters who access and interact with the Matrix through the power of their mind only. This attribute mea- sures their strength in manipulating the Matrix.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Essence All characters have this attribute. It functions as a capacity rating for how much cyberware, bioware, and other augmentations characters can hold. The metahuman body can only contain so much ’ware before it loses the small spark that separates a living being from a machine. This attribute primarily exists due to the degrees of difference between biology and technology&mdash;it simply does not flow well through technology and becomes limited as your Essence de- clines (specifically, anytime your Essence goes below any whole integer, you lose a corresponding point of Magic or Resonance). Also, some magic, particularly healing magic, has less of an effect on you as you gain more augmentations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Condition Monitors Condition Monitors track the health of your character. Each character has two: Physical and Stun. Condition Monitors are a series of boxes set in rows of three (see sam-</p>
<p class="calibre1">threats, and resist some magic threats.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charisma This is the pull you exert on other people. Whether you are using your looks, your speaking ability, your fashion sense, your sheer power, or some combination of any of the above, Charisma shows how powerful you can be in persuading oth- ers to a course of action. Faces thrive on Charisma.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Special Attributes Special attributes are:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Edge</p>
<p class="calibre1">ple at right). Your Phys- ical Condition Monitor has (Body/2, rounded up) + 8 boxes, while the Stun Condition Mon- itor has (Willpower/2, rounded up) + 8 boxes. When a row of boxes on a monitor is filled, the character takes a &ndash;1 dice pool penalty to all tests except Damage Resis- tance. Each row filled on either monitor increases the penalty by 1. When either monitor is filled;</p>
<p class="calibre1">Physical Condition Monitor</p>
<p class="calibre1">-1</p>
<p class="calibre1">-2</p>
<p class="calibre1">-3</p>
<p class="calibre1">-4</p>
<p class="calibre1">This critical statistic measures the undefinable, putting it on tricky ground right at the outset. It is that combination of guts, risk, and heedless igno-</p>
<p class="calibre1">the character is unconscious. If the Stun monitor is filled, remaining damage becomes Physical; extra physical damage becomes Overflow (p.&nbsp;121).</p>
<p class="calibre1">GAME CONCEPTS // CHARACTER TRAITS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Skills Skills are the next layer of ability placed on top of attributes. They are learned abilities, things characters gain through training and practice. Skills are used to fire weapons, sneak past guards, charm a grumpy security officer, drive a getaway car, and many other things&mdash;so many that there is an entire chapter on skills, starting on p.&nbsp;92. They have a rank from 1 to 9. They can be modified by spells, gear, and other effects, but their augmented increase can never be more than +4.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Initiative Often, in a role-playing game, activities can happen in a free-flowing manner, with people tak- ing actions as they need to, without a strong turn structure. Sometimes, namely in combat, a strict turn order is needed, and the Initiative stat helps determine how that turn order will go. The Initia- tive stat has two components: The first number is the Initiative rank, which is derived by adding Re- action to Intuition (it may be enhanced by other factors such as augmentations). The second com- ponent is the Initiative Dice, which is a number of D6s that the player rolls to determine their Initia- tive Score at the beginning of any encounter. In- stead of counting hits, the player adds the numbers on their Initiative Dice together, then combines them with their Initiative rank to get the Initiative Score for that encounter. The number of Initiative Dice for a character starts at 1 and may be in- creased by augmentations, spells, or other effects. You can never have more than 5D6 Initiative Dice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Attack Rating When a character is going on the offensive, they have either their bare hands or a weapon to help them lay down the damage. The weapon has a combination of stopping power, accuracy, and recoil compensation (for firearms) that increases its overall effectiveness. These are captured in the Attack Rating. A character’s Attack Rating for un- armed combat is Strength + Reaction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Defense Rating This stat is an important part of combat, rep- resenting how well the character and their worn armor resist incoming attacks. It is a combination of Body, worn armor, and other effects, including augmentations and magic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Qualities Characters often have innate characteristics or consequences from past experiences that shape the way they are today. These are represented as quali- ties, which can be either positive or negative&mdash;that</p>
<p class="calibre1">is, providing benefits or penalties. Qualities are discussed and listed on p.&nbsp;70. Gear 39 You can be good, you can be skilled, but some- times you need the right toys to get the job done. These are some of the categories of gear that shad- owrunners use; all of them are discussed in more detail in the gear listing starting on p.&nbsp;247.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Augmentations Augmentations are alterations to a physical body that enhance an individual’s capabilities to some degree. It may be a limb that increas- es strength and agility, it may be armor plates woven into the skin, or it may be replacement glands or organs that enhance existing capabil- ities or add new ones. Augmentations are listed starting on p.&nbsp;282.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Miscellaneous Gear There are many types of gear, including commlinks, other electronics, breaking and entering gear, and more. Those are all grouped together on the character sheet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weapons You may be the type of shadowrunner who thinks a good run means one where no shots are fired, or you may be the type who measures success in the number of explosions set off in the course of a run. Either way, though, you want a weapon at your side, whether it’s your first or last option. Weapons are listed starting on p.&nbsp;247, and they are listed separately on the character sheet since they are referenced so frequently. What can we say? It’s a violent world out there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Contacts Shadowrunners have their team to help them out, but they have more than that&mdash;they have con- tacts, the network of people who help them obtain gear, uncover information, and otherwise get the job done. Contacts are discussed more on p.&nbsp;50.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lifestyle Whether you’re out all night on a job or looking to turn in early after a long day of running, every shadowrunner needs a place to crash. And some food to eat while they’re there. A shadowrunner’s lifestyle represents the cost of staying alive, getting enough food and shelter to be ready to fight an- other day. This aspect is covered in more detail on p.&nbsp;56.</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHARACTER TRAITS // GAME CONCEPTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Specialized Traits The elements above are common to pretty much 40 all Shadowrun characters, but there are some things that are particular to specialized characters, notably Awakened characters and Matrix-focused characters. These include: the spells mages use (p.&nbsp;131), a magician’s Initiate Grade (p.&nbsp;166), metam- agics (p.&nbsp;167), adept powers (p.&nbsp;156), cyberdecks (p.&nbsp;174), programs (p.&nbsp;184), complex forms (p.&nbsp;189), and echoes (p.&nbsp;195).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Game Timing and Actions When the action picks up and the game moves into taking turns in initiative order, it’s good to know how much time is passing and what you can do in that time. When you get to take a turn and describe what your character is doing, your actions are contained in a combat round. A combat round lasts for about three seconds of in-universe time. Everyone, player characters and non-player characters alike, take a single player turn within that round. Each combat round, you gain an action allotment that you use on your player turn. Actions come in two categories: Minor and Major. The basic action allotment for each character is 1 Minor Action and 1 Major Action per combat round. Players get 1 ad- ditional Minor Action for every Initiative Die they have. Players can trade Minor and Major Actions, using a Major Action to perform a Minor Action or using 4 Minor Actions to perform a Major Action</p>
<p class="calibre1">action sample Yu, a covert-ops specialist, is sneaking into a corporate research facility to steal a bleeding-edge prototype. Some se- curity guards are between him and the building he wants to get into, so he’ll have to figure out how to get by them without raising an alarm. He decides a stealth assault will work best, so the gamemaster puts Yu and the guards into Initiative. On Yu’s player turn, he decides to do a Move action to get closer to his destination. He gets near the corner of the building he wants to enter, so he uses the Take Cover action to provide a little protection. He didn’t have a weapon out, but thankfully he has an easy-to-draw blowgun, and he is able to ready it with a Quick Draw action. That’s three Mi- nor Actions. He knows the blowdart works best when it hits exposed skin, so he chooses the Called Shot Minor Action to aim at a guard’s neck. He has now used all four of his Minor Actions. For his Major Action, he chooses to Attack. He used his Major Action last, but it didn’t have to be that way. He could have used Quick Draw to ready the weapon, then fired it, then used Move, Take Cover, Drop Prone, or even Dodge based on how well the attack went. The order of the actions is up to the player.</p>
<p class="calibre1">actions</p>
<p class="calibre1">Activate/Deactivate Focus Assist Avoid Incoming Astral Projection Block Attack Call a Shot Banish Spirit Change Device Mode Cast Spell Command Drone Cleanse Command Spirit Counterspell Dismiss Spirit Full Defense Dodge Manifest Drop Object Observe in Detail Drop Prone Pick Up/Put Down Object Hit the Dirt Ready Weapon Intercept Reload Weapon Move Rigger Jump In Multiple Attacks Sprint Quick Draw Summon Spirit Reload Smartgun Use Simple Device Shift Perception Use Skill Stand Up Take Aim Take Cover Trip</p>
<p class="calibre1">(possibly providing an extra attack in a single play- er turn). Each action has a note next to it indicating when it can be performed; this is either Initiative (I) or Anytime (A). Initiative Actions can only be performed on the character’s player turn during an initiative round, while Anytime Actions can be used at any time. Note, though, that in order to perform an Anytime Action, you must have an Action left. If you spent them all on your turn, you can’t use one later. So sometimes it pays to save an action for later in the round if you act early. Note that actions cannot be carried from one round to another unless that is specifically allowed in a rule. Along with these actions, enough words can be spoken or conversation can be shared to fill three seconds; if there is any doubt about the amount of words that can be said, time it! Note that specialized Matrix actions are de- scribed on p.&nbsp;179.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Minor Actions These actions usually take only a small amount of focus or a quick and simple thought or move- ment. A key point among Minor Actions is that they generally do not require a test of any kind. That doesn’t mean in truly dire situations where the pressure is on that the gamemaster can’t ask for a test to be made&mdash;it just means that usually, as long as you have the action available, you can perform the task by simply declaring the use of it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Activate (Deactivate) Focus (I) A character can activate or deactivate a bonded focus that they are carrying on their person with a Minor Action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">GAME CONCEPTS // GAME TIMING AND ACTIONS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Avoid Incoming (A) A character can use this action when it is not their player turn to get away from an incoming Blast or Gas attack. With this action, a character makes a Reaction + Athletics &ndash; Dodge Penalty roll (see Dodge Penalty table, p.&nbsp;311, for these values). Hits on the test allow a character to move a num- ber of meters equal to their hits in a direction of their choosing, but they shouldn’t know the results of the scatter until after they decide which way they’re headed. If they choose to move more than 2 meters, they dive to the ground at the end of their defense and gain the Prone status. This action can- not be used if the character has taken a previous Avoid Incoming, Move, or Sprint action this com- bat round and prevents the use of another Avoid Incoming, Move, or Sprint action for the remainder of the combat round.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Block (A) A character can add their Close Combat skill to a single Defense test in melee. The roll must hap- pen in the same player turn in which the action is used.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Call a Shot (I) Edge allows for some specific called shots with- out dice penalty or with reduced penalty, but you can increase the damage by 2 by taking a &ndash;4 dice pool penalty. This must be combined with the At- tack action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Change Device Mode (A) A character may use a Minor Action to activate, deactivate, or switch the mode on any device that they are linked to by a direct neural interface, be it a wired or wireless link. This includes activating or deactivating cyberware, changing a smartgun’s firing settings, switching a commlink to hidden mode, turning a device’s wireless functionality off, and so on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Command Drone (I) A character may issue a command to a drone they control. If multiple drones are controlled through a rigger command console (RCC), the same command can be issued to every drone. If a different command is desired for each drone, it requires multiple Minor Actions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Command Spirit (I) A character may issue a service command to a single spirit or group of spirits under their con- trol, or dismiss them. The service must be the same. If multiple services are desired, multiple Minor Actions must be used.</p>
<p class="calibre1">block example Caboose and Whitney are taking on a couple of gang enforcers. They’re both built for speed, so they both go before the enforcers. Caboose decides to Move, Quick Draw a weapon, Take Aim, Call a Shot, and Attack, using up his full allotment of actions for this combat round. Whitney is a little more conservative&mdash;she Moves, Takes Aim, and Attacks, saving two Minor Actions. The gang en- forcers go next. The first one to act Attacks Whitney, and Whitney decides to Block. Her Reaction is 4 and Intuition is 3, so her Defense test normally would be 7, but she has a Close Combat skill of 5, so she gets to roll 12 dice. She gets 5 hits on the Defense test versus the enforcer’s 4, so the Block worked. If the enforcer decides to attack Caboose next, Ca- boose won’t be able to Block, since he has no Minor Ac- tions left. If the enforcer attacks Whitney, Whitney can choose to Block&mdash;or not, if she wants to conserve that Minor Action for later. But since there are no more attack- ers, using it now is better than wasting it!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodge (A) A character can add their Athletics skill to a sin- gle Defense test in combat. The roll must happen in the same player turn in which the action is used.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Drop Object (A) A character may drop an object they are hold- ing in their hand or hands as a single Minor Ac- tion. The objects fall to the ground and may suffer damage or ill effects if the gamemaster so chooses, depending on the distance of the fall and the land- ing spot.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Drop Prone (I) A character may choose to drop themselves to the ground as a Minor Action. They gain the Prone status (p.&nbsp;53) until they choose to use the Stand Up Action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hit the Dirt (A) A character can quickly drop to the ground in a defensive manner, gaining +2 dice on the Defense test of an incoming attack. They gain the Prone status (p.&nbsp;53) and also suffer a &ndash;2 dice pool penal- ty on any subsequent tests using active skills until they use the Stand Up action, due to the awkward- ness of their fall.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Intercept (A) If an opponent comes within Close attack range, you may go out of Initiative order and make an At- tack action as long as you have both a Minor and a Major Action still available in this round (because</p>
<p class="calibre1">GAME TIMING AND ACTIONS // GAME CONCEPTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">you either are after the attacking player in Initia- tive order or you deferred some of your actions). This counts as your Attack Major Action for the 42 player turn. If you’re already out of Major Actions this round, you’re drek out of luck. This cannot be used with ranged weapons.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Move (I) A character can use this Minor Action for 10 meters of movement. Only one Move Action is al- lowed per player turn.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Multiple Attacks (I) A character can attack more than one oppo- nent, assuming ammunition, reach, and enemy placement allow it. Split your dice pool evenly among all targets, or if you are using two different forms of attack, use half the dice pool for each, rounded down. This action must be used in con- junction with an Attack Major Action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Quick Draw (I) A character may quick draw a pistol, pis- tol-sized weapon, or small throwing weapon and immediately attack with this Minor Action. The Attack action must be used in conjunction with this action. They must have the appropriate gear, augmentation, or quality to be allowed this ac- tion&mdash;if they don’t have something that allows this action, they can’t take it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reload Smartgun (I) A character linked to a ready smartgun may use a mental command to eject the weapon’s clip while sliding a new one in with one deft motion, assum- ing that the new ammo is readily available.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shift Perception (I) A character capable of Astral Perception may shift perception to or from astral space as a Minor Action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stand Up (I) Whether they chose to be prone or they got knocked down, a character uses this action to get back to their feet and remove the Prone status (p.&nbsp;53).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Take Aim (I) A character gains a +1 dice pool bonus with the use of this action. The action can only be taken once per combat round, but if the bonus is not used, it carries over to the next combat round, allowing it to be combined with actions taken over the course of several combat round. If the character takes a player turn without taking the Take Aim or Attack actions, any carryover bonuses from previous rounds are</p>
<p class="calibre1">lost. The maximum dice pool bonus from the use of this action is equal to the character’s Willpower. A character may take aim with a ready firearm, bow, or exotic ranged weapon. If the character is using image magnification or a targeting scope, the Take Aim action must be used to line up the shot in order to receive any bonus from the item. In this case, the first action of Take Aim does not provide any additional bonus beyond enabling the function of the modification.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Take Cover (I) The character uses something in their area to provide protection, but they also must operate from the constraints created by the cover. Taking cover gives the player the Cover I, II, III, or IV sta- tus (see p.&nbsp;52).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trip (I) This action focuses more on bringing the target to the ground than on doing damage. Can only be done with a melee weapon and must be combined with an Attack Major Action. Decrease the base damage of the attack by 2P; if it hits, target rolls Athletics + Agility with a threshold of the adjusted DV of the attack. If the target fails, they gain the Prone status.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Major Actions These actions take a bit more concentration or time to complete. Several involve a test of some kind, but some simply occur as long as you have the Action available. Just like Minor Actions, if there is no test involved but the gamemaster feels the pressure is on and one should be required, they have final say in the matter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Assist (A) You can become a helper on a Teamwork test, working to help one of your teammates on some task (see Teamwork Tests, p.&nbsp;36).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Astral Projection (I) A character capable of Astral Projection (full magician or aspected magician) may shift their consciousness to or from the astral plane as a Ma- jor Action. The process is complete the moment the action is declared and therefore places them on the astral plane immediately, including for the remainder of the current combat round.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Attack (I) A character may perform one of a variety of forms of attack with this Major Action. See the Combat chapter (p.&nbsp;104) for more details.</p>
<p class="calibre1">GAME CONCEPTS // GAME TIMING AND ACTIONS</p>
<p class="calibre1">43</p>
<p class="calibre1">Banish Spirit (I) Any character may attempt a Banishing on with a spirit as a Major Action (see Banishing, p.&nbsp;147).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cast Spell (I) A character may cast a spell as a Major Action. For details on how, see Spells (p.&nbsp;130).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cleanse (I) Awakened characters use this action to erase traces of their magic activity (see p.&nbsp;160).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Counterspell (A) See p.&nbsp;143 for details</p>
<p class="calibre1">Full Defense (A) A character can add their Willpower to all De- fense tests until their next combat round.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manifest (I) Characters who are astrally projecting use this action to appear as a ghostly form (see p.&nbsp;160).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Observe in Detail (I) A character may make a detailed observation by taking a Major Action. This action allows a Percep- tion test (see Perception, p.&nbsp;96) or Assensing test (p.&nbsp;159). This action is intended for determining details that may be obscured due to the pace and rigors of combat. It is assumed that everyone engaged in a combat is aware of the presence of everyone else, barring the use of Stealth or obscuring magic, but not necessarily details of their gear or equipment, and in some particularly hectic or rushed circumstances, the identity of individuals. In the midst of a hectic gun- fight/brawl in the dark, the winner of the brawl, who is now sprinting toward your character, may not be identifiable without an Observe in Detail action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pick Up/Put Down Object (I) A character may pick up an object within reach or put down one that they were holding as a Major Action. This action means care is taken to put the object down or pick it up. If the picked-up object is a weapon, this counts as readying the weapon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ready Weapon (I) A character may ready a weapon by using this action. This includes drawing and readying</p>
<p class="calibre1">GAME TIMING AND ACTIONS // GAME CONCEPTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">a firearm; pulling a melee weapon from a sheath or pocket; taking out and readying a grenade or throwing knife; or any other kind of weapon 44 preparation. Almost all weapons require this ac- tion before they are ready for use, though many times it occurs before combat even starts. Small weapons such as throwing knives and shuriken can be readied in bunches, with a total number equal to the character’s Agility attribute pulled into the character’s off-hand with a single Ready Weapon action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reload Weapon (I) Weapons without a smartlink, or weapons where the smartlink is currently disengaged, require a Major Action to reload. Reloading a weapon re- fills the weapon to its maximum capacity as long as the character has sufficient ammunition to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rigger Jump In (I) A character with a vehicle control rig (VCR) and rigger-adapted vehicle or drone or a rigger com- mand console (RCC) may jump in to control the vehicle or operate the RCC with a Major Action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sprint (I) A character may move at a Sprint with this Major Action. Movement starts at 15 meters and is increased by 1 meter per hit on an Athletics + Agility Test. Only one Sprint Action is allowed per player turn, and it cannot be performed in the same turn as a Move ac- tion or Avoid Incoming action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Summon Spirit (I) A character capable of summoning may use a Major Action to summon a spirit to assist them. A spirit that is already summoned is controlled using the Command Spirit Minor Action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Use Simple Device (I) A character can use any simple device with a Major Action. Simple devices are those that are acti- vated with a simple movement like a thumb trigger, pressing a single key, or tapping a single icon. It takes longer to interact with more complex devices, with required time being up to the game- master or listed with the description of specific gear. Remember, a device connected via a DNI-en- abled system uses the Minor Action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Use Skill (I) A character may use an appropriate skill by us- ing a Major Action (see Skills, p.&nbsp;92).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Glitches and Critical Glitches If more than half of the dice that you roll on a test are 1s, you have rolled a glitch. If you rolled a glitch without a single hit on the test, you have rolled a critical glitch.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Glitches Rolling a glitch means something went wrong. It should be inconvenient rather than disastrous&mdash; dropping a weapon after swinging with it, or brief- ly forgetting your assumed name after someone is fooled by your disguise. If you rolled enough hits, a test with a glitch may also be a success. The glitch doesn’t cancel the success, but it causes a problem afterward that you need to recover from.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Critical Glitch A critical glitch is significantly worse than a glitch. It’s the errant gunshot that misses its target and ricochets back to hit one of your teammates, or the attempted Matrix hack that sends your name, photo, and location straight to the Grid Overwatch Division. It should be difficult and could have lasting ramifications, but it shouldn’t be fatal, and it shouldn’t penalize the character so much that they stop having fun. (Having a mage permanently lose several points off their Magic rating would be an example of a no-fun critical glitch). Use critical glitches to advance stories with an air of desperation without pummeling the play- ers into hopelessness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Edge Much of Shadowrun, Sixth World is structured around gaining and using Edge. One way to think of Edge is building up tactical advantages that culminate in a sudden move toward victory. It’s Muhammad Ali playing rope-a-dope with George Foreman for five rounds before turning it around and going aggressively toward an eighth-round knockout. It’s soon-to-be-Emperor Babur at Pani- pat using speed and training to envelop a superior force until they were so battered that they could be swept away. It’s both what you plan for and the unexpected moment when you seize an opportuni- ty and make it your own. Edge is tracked on the character sheet, but since it can be added to and subtracted from free- ly during game sessions, it’s easiest to track with some sort of token, such as pennies, poker chips, or even candies. The candies can even be consumed when spent! Characters can only have one expenditure of Edge per round action. That expenditure cannot in-</p>
<p class="calibre1">GAME CONCEPTS // GLITCHES AND CRITICAL GLITCHES</p>
<p class="calibre1">clude multiple boosts or actions, or a combination of the two, but the same boost can be multiplied if the player wishes (e.g., spending one Edge allows the player to reroll one die; they could spend two to reroll two dice). In those cases, the expenditure of Edge must apply to the same roll&mdash;you cannot, for example, buy a reroll on your test and also on your opponent’s test. Characters start a gaming session with Edge points equal to their Edge rank. In the session, Edge can be carried over and accumulated up to a limit of 7, including the Edge provided by the character’s Edge attribute. Any Edge garnered over your base attribute goes away when you complete any ongoing confrontation; this includes com- bat, hacking, social persuasion, and any situation where bonus Edge might be accumulated. If, at the end of the confrontation, your current Edge points are less than your Edge attribute, you stay at the lower level. If you want more Edge, you have to earn it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gaining Edge Gear, spells, qualities, and other items provide bo- nus Edge or cancel Edge given to other players. Social situations can provide Edge to one side or another&mdash; see the Social Edge table on p.&nbsp;98. At the beginning of</p>
<p class="calibre1">an Attack or hack action, compare the Attack Rating and Defense Rating of the opponents (or, if there are multiple targets, the highest of the combatants). If ei- ther is 4 or more greater than the other, that player 45 gets a point of Edge. If the attack is area-effect or at- tacking multiple targets, compare to the highest De- fense Rating among them. No player may gain more than two bonus points of Edge in a combat round. Edge can also be gained in social situations, based on the attitudes the different participants have toward each other, their bearing, and other factors. In addition to the ways to gain Edge through game mechanics, players can gain Edge through role-playing. Maybe a player does something bril- liant, especially funny, or otherwise awesome. If they do, the gamemaster can award them with a bonus point of Edge for the quality play they bring to the table. This bonus Edge is subject to all the limitations of gaining and keeping Edge as normal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Preventing Edge Abuse Edge can only be gained when it is part of a real opposed encounter. Gamemasters should not award points of Edge that are not directly part of an ongoing confrontation, and they should not re- ward players who are attempting to game the sys-</p>
<p class="calibre1">EDGE // GAME CONCEPTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">tem. For example, players might attempt to aim their weapon at an innocent passerby to stack up on the Edge they might gain from targeting such 46 a person, or they might try to take multiple looks at something that isn’t a real opponent when they have better vision than them in an effort to stack up extra Edge. The easiest part of this guideline is to say that Edge should not be awarded to any player taking an action solely to gain Edge. The action must play another role in the ongoing con- frontation/discussion/hack/whatever. Beyond that, the guidelines are as described above, with the bottom line being that the gamemaster has final discretion on when Edge should be awarded and when it should be withheld.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spending Edge Edge is spent through Edge Boosts, some of which allow special Edge Actions. Boosts range in cost from 1 to 5 Edge. Boosts are straightforward add-ons you can throw into a roll. Typically boosts are selected before a die roll; exceptions are noted in the descriptions. Note that nothing can ever re- duce the cost of and Edge Action to 0 Edge.</p>
<p class="calibre1">1- Edge Boosts • Reroll one die: Pick any die and reroll it. It can be yours or your opponent’s, but the re- sult stands no matter what you roll. This is done after all rolls have been made. • Add 3 to your Initiative Score: This one kicks in before combat even starts. You can choose to spend one point of Edge to increase your Initiative Score by 3. It can also be used during the fight if you want to move up in the order on the next Initiative Cycle. • Use an Edge Action: You can choose to use one of the 1-Edge Actions described in the Edge Action section.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2- Edge Boosts • +1 to a single die roll: You get to add 1 to a single die. Maybe that’s making a 4 a 5 to get another hit, or making 1 a 2 to avoid a glitch. • Give ally 1 Edge: You do something that offers an advantage for another member of your team. Take away two of your own Edge, and give one to a teammate. • Negate 1 Edge of a foe: No sense in letting the bad guys get the best of you if you don’t need to. You spend two of your own Edge, but one vanishes from the opponent of your choice. • Use an Edge Action: You can choose to use one of the 2-Edge Actions described in the Edge Action section.</p>
<p class="calibre1">GAME CONCEPTS // EDGE</p>
<p class="calibre1">3- Edge Boosts • Buy one automatic hit: You get an automatic hit. This one adds on to the total hits you roll. This isn’t an automatic success at what- ever test you’re attempting, just another hit to add to your total. • Heal one box of Stun damage: You catch a second wind and clear a box from your Stun Condition Monitor. 4- Edge Boosts • Add Edge to your dice pool: Add your Edge as a dice pool bonus to your roll, and make 6s explode. “Exploding” means that 6s count as a hit and can be rerolled in an attempt to get an additional hit. If another hit is scored, tack it on; if another 6 is rolled, tack on a hit and roll it again. Keep the hits coming! If a 1 is rolled after a 6, it does not count toward your total for calculating glitches. • Heal 1 point of Physical damage: You take off a single box of damage from your Phys- ical Condition Monitor&mdash;your advantage over your opponents means they didn’t hit you quite as hard as they first thought. • Reroll all failed dice: Pretty much what it says&mdash;after a roll is made, you can reroll all failed dice. This Edge Boost cannot be used if a glitch or critical glitch is rolled. • Use an Edge Action: You can choose to use one of the 4-Edge Actions described in the Edge Action section.</p>
<p class="calibre1">5- Edge Boosts • Count 2s as glitches for the target: Time to get counteroffensive! When an opponent rolls, both 1s and 2s count in their total to determine if they glitch or critical glitch. • Create special effect: Bring your creativity to the table! You spend this Edge and some- thing fortuitous happens. It’s up to you and your gamemaster to determine what it is, but it should certainly turn the tides slightly in your favor. Burst pipes, approaching sirens, incoming DocWagon, an angry spirit, some- thing that adds a little more oomph to your side or puts a little stress on the enemy. • Use an Edge Action: You can choose to use one of the 5-Edge Actions described in the Edge Action section.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Edge Actions These actions by themselves do not cost either a Minor or Major Action, but they must be used</p>
<p class="calibre1">in conjunction with an action; each Edge Action mentions in parentheses what action must be tak- en at the same time. In all cases, the decision to use an Edge Action must be made before the test 47 connected to that action. If you’ve already rolled dice for the action, you cannot retroactively use an Edge Action. Edge Actions include: • Anticipation (Multiple Attacks, Ranged Attack): You played this combat like a game of chess, using each strike to direct your opponents to a particular spot. Now they’re there, and you can attack without even looking at them, since you’re firing at a spot, not a person. When performing this Multiple Attack, roll your full dice pool for each target. Cost: 4 Edge • Big Speech (Use Skill [Influence]): A torrent of words flows from your mouth, reaching heights of eloquence and inspiration mortals rarely hit. Roll your Influence + Charisma test twice; the first time it counts as a Team- work test, meaning you can add your hits to the dice pool for the second roll. The second roll acts as your hits for the test. Cost: 4 Edge • Bring the Drama (Use Skill [Con]): While spinning your con, you get to a part where extra drama would be appropriate, and you bring it. Maybe it’s a dramatic speech, maybe it’s some tears or sorrowful histri- onics, but whatever the case, you take ac- tion to tug at the heartstrings of the mark and bring them to your side. For a quick con, this can bring in 200 nuyen from on- lookers. When used as part of a longer-term con, you can increase your asking price by twenty percent, and the mark will agree to it. Cost: 2 Edge • Called Shot&mdash;Disarm (any attack): Success- ful hit does no damage to target, but their weapon is knocked from their hands. Cost: 5 Edge. • Called Shot&mdash;Vitals (any attack): The attack goes for the vitals, adding 3 extra damage if it hits (along with net hits, as usual). Cost: 5 Edge • Fire from Cover (Ranged Attack, must be in Cover IV): You sneak an attack out while maintaining your cover. Attacks from cover may be made without spending a Minor Ac- tion. Cost: 2 Edge • Knockout Blow (Melee Attack): You use your advantage to truly bring the hurt on an opponent. If your inflicted damage of any type is greater than the target’s Willpower, immediately fill up the Stun Condition Mon- itor. The target is unconscious. No damage</p>
<p class="calibre1">EDGE // GAME CONCEPTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">overflows to the Physical Condition Moni- tor. Cost: 2 Edge • Shank (Melee Attack): When attacking with a blade, your advantage turns into a targeted strike. Reduce the Call a Shot penalty to &ndash;2. Cost: 1 Edge • Sudden Insight (Any): Perform an action in which you have no skill levels without pen- alty. This does not allow you to use skills that cannot be performed untrained. Cost: 1 Edge • Tactical Roll (Hit the Dirt): You drop to avoid incoming fire, with an agile roll that helps you make an attack as you roll. If you use a melee Attack action on the same com- bat round, you do not get the dice pool pen- alty that comes with the Prone status (p.&nbsp;53) or Hit the Dirt Action (p.&nbsp;41). For the next round, you do not take the &ndash;2 dice pool pen- alty from Close or Near attacks that come with the Prone status. Cost: 1 Edge • Tumble (Melee Attack): Your advantages combine to give you the chance to not just hurt your opponent but bring them to the ground. If the damage being inflicted on a target is greater than the target’s Body, they are brought down, giving them the Prone status. Cost: 1 Edge • Wrest (Block): When in melee combat, if you successfully Block an attack, you can use this action to wrest your opponent’s weapon</p>

If you get more hits, you take the weapon from them. If you get fewer hits, the attacker retains the weapon. Cost: 2 Edge</p>
<p class="calibre1">Burning Edge Sometimes you need to use Edge in an act of total desperation, a last-ditch measure to stay alive. These uses are so extreme that you perma- nently lose 1 point of Edge rank (even taking it down to zero if you so choose). You also spend all accumulated Edge. Spent Edge can be re-earned, and burned Edge can eventually be bought back with Karma (the currency for character advance- ment). Edge can be burned even at times when Edge normally cannot be spent. Here are the uses of burning Edge: Smackdown: Sometimes you want&mdash;or desper- ately need&mdash;the blow you’re taking to definitely hit, and hit hard. Smackdown counts as an auto- matic success on whatever test you were about to make, with four net hits to boot. This has to be a test the character is capable of performing&mdash;it cannot, for example, be a spellcasting test for a non-Awakened character, or a skill test involving a skill that the character does not have and that cannot be used untrained. Not Dead Yet: Just when it looks like you’re about to shuffle off this mortal coil, you make a move that buys you a little bit more life. Maybe it’s the oddly cushioned awning that saves you during a free-fall, or the implanted cyberdeck in your head that happens to deflect a bullet just enough to keep you alive, but something that would be about to kill you instead allows you to live. Use Not Dead Yet when death is imminent for the character; burning the point of Edge allows you to survive the killing blow, though it does not necessarily remove you from the situation that put your life in danger in the first place (if, say, you were wearing cement shoes at the bottom of the Puget Sound, burning Edge might allow you to find an old, discarded scuba tank, but it won’t automatically get you out from under wa- ter). Used judiciously, Not Dead Yet can give you a chance to stay alive. Used unwisely, and it’s just one more bit of flailing before your character goes to that big dark alley in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wild Die In the description of certain, gear, spells, and qualities you’ll find a reference to the wild die. This little wonder can make or break a move. When a wild die is in play, use a different color or easi- ly identifiable die to track the result. The die adds</p>
<p class="calibre1">GAME CONCEPTS // WILD DIE</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the pool directly and a hit with the wild die (5 or 6) counts as 3 hits instead of just 1. On the downside, a 1 cancels all the 5s rolled. A 2, 3, or 4 on the wild die means nothing. If Edge is being used and 6s explode, a 6 on the wild die counts as 3 hits and can then be rerolled. Any additional hits, rolled 1s, or re-rolls are count- ed as a regular die, not a wild die.</p>
<p class="calibre1">How Things Get Done Shadowrun does not have classes for the char- acters. Instead, you build a character to your vi- sion, adding the skills, qualities, and gear that will give you a mix of effective and fun things to do in the game. There are plenty of approaches to take to the myriad problems the Sixth World will throw at you; here are the basics.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Combat This is the act of making people get down and stay down. The Sixth World offers a wide variety of weaponry, from guns to blades to tasers to weird things your decker just kludged together in their basement. Will you go stealthy and silent with hid- den knives and implanted razors, or big and loud with gunfire and explosions and an ammo dealer who sends you resupply drones every fifteen min- utes? Whatever you choose, you should be ready to avoid damage as well as dish it out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Important Attributes Agility for targeting, Intuition and Reaction for acting quickly and avoiding fire, Strength if fight- ing unarmed, and Body for absorbing damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Important Skills Firearms and Close Combat to attack, Athletics to throw weapons and avoid them, Engineering to fire vehicle-mounted weapons. Maybe some Biotech to stitch up wounds. Stealth to avoid being seen, Per- ception to catch people trying to sneak up on you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Other Needs You’ll want cash to spend on the right weap- ons, armor, and augmentations. Qualities like Guts may help you gain an advantage in a fight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matrix The cloud-based network of electronic devices is omnipresent in people’s lives. It affects the way they drive, work, play, communicate, and entertain themselves. That means that anyone who messes</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the Matrix has the chance to affect all aspects of a person’s life. That’s why deckers and techno- mancers are both sought after and feared. They might redirect traffic, confuse a building’s security 49 cameras, make guards’ weapons eject their ammo, or all manner of online mischief. They also might have to duke it out with the online security forces trying to keep the peace. More details can be found in the Matrix chapter (p.&nbsp;170).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Important Attributes Logic for most hacking tests, Intuition for that occasional inspired leap. Willpower to defend yourself and resist damage online. Technomancers need to acquire Resonance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Important Skills Cracking and Electronics, obviously. Engineer- ing might help keep gear working properly. Tech- nomancers need Tasking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Other Needs Deckers need to save up their cash to go into battle with a sweet cyberdeck (p.&nbsp;174) and cyberjack (p.&nbsp;176). Don’t shortchange yourself! They’ll also want a suite of programs (p.&nbsp;184) to go with it. Technomancers don’t need the cyberdeck, but they’ll want to learn some complex forms (p.&nbsp;189).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic Magic is a way of breaking all the rules of the Sixth World&mdash;except, of course, for the rules of magic. Fire can erupt from empty air, objects can be reshaped or made to levitate, people can be made invisible, and so on. Whatever task you want to accomplish can be assisted in some way by mag- ic. The entire gamut of magic options is discussed in the Magic chapter (p.&nbsp;126).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Important Attributes Magic, obviously, is vital, and Willpower is im- portant for staying focused while casting spells. Adepts will want to follow the combat or social paths, depending on how they use their adept powers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Important Skills The key skills are Sorcery, Conjuring, and En- chanting; you can go for all three, or choose one or two areas of focus. Perception is useful for spotting the targets for casting your spell, and Astral is very useful for checking out auras and traveling the as- tral plane.</p>
<p class="calibre1">HOW THINGS GET DONE // GAME CONCEPTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Other Needs Awakened characters need spells (p.&nbsp;131), for- mulas (p.&nbsp;70), and perhaps reagents (p.&nbsp;153) and foci (p.&nbsp;154). Besides those goods, magicians have the luxury of not having to buy too much gear, though some armor and a sidearm can be useful, along with a commlink.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rigging The roads, skies, and waters of the Sixth World are filled with drones and vehicles, and someone who can control them can move fast and smooth, outpacing others, or cause chaos for their opposi- tion. Or both. The masters of vehicles and drones are called riggers, and their mechanical army is ev- erywhere. Whether they serve as getaway drivers, smuggle goods across some border or another, or sneak in drones for espionage or assault, they can help on almost any job.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Important Attributes Reaction is critical for maneuvering vehi- cles, and Logic and Intuition can be useful when jumped into a vehicle. Body helps determine how much rigging you can handle and also helps you survive a crash.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Important Skills Piloting is the big one. Cracking, Electronics, Engineering, and Perception also have important roles to play.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Other Needs Cash. So much cash. Cars cost money. Boats cost money. Drones cost money, especially when you keep flying them into things. And the gear to control all of that costs money. While other shadowrunners think about their payday in terms of nuyen, riggers’ preferred unit of currency is mi- crodrones.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Social Shadowrunners with social skills&mdash;often called faces, since they function as the face of the group in negotiations and other discussions&mdash;are useful everywhere there are people, and even some plac- es where there aren’t&mdash;some runners have enough charm to stop a charging rhino in its tracks. Wheth- er they are negotiating for a bigger payday, talking their way past security, or figuring out how to fit in at a posh social gathering, shadowrunners with social skills are extremely handy to have around. The uses of social skills are set out on p.&nbsp;94, 96, and 97 of the Skills chapter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Important Attributes Charisma. With a little extra Charisma layered on top. Judging intentions and remembering key facts can be useful, so the other mental skills&mdash;In- tuition, Logic, and Willpower&mdash;can help in a pinch. The rest depends on what skills they want to layer on top of their Charisma, for those inevitable times when their charm fails. Social adepts&mdash;adepts who channel their magic into charm instead of punch- ing power&mdash;need Magic, of course.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Important Skills Con and Influence are the key skills, and they probably should layer some specializations with those skills. Perception is also useful for when fac- es want to look someone up and down and get a good sense of them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Other Needs Some gear can boost social skills or can boost other skills and attributes to make up for deficien- cies left when you spent your character-creation resources on Charisma, Con, and Influence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Contacts A shadowrunner who goes it alone is often one that winds up in a lonely, solitary grave. Experienced shadowrunners build a network of people who can provide the information and goods critical to their work. Maybe it’s a bartender who knows the people in their neighborhood, or an arms dealer who can get the ammo that doesn’t flow through legal channels, or a Lone Star officer who likes to shoot the breeze about who just got arrested. These people and more can be reached out to in times of need. Contacts can be acquired during Character Creation (p.&nbsp;66), and they also can be awarded in</p>
<p class="calibre1">legwork results</p>
<p class="calibre1">0 No useful information. 1 Basic, broadly available background information 2 A few nuggets of information gleaned from casual study 3 Information from previous coursework or loose professional knowledge 4 More esoteric knowledge, some whispers of gossip 5 Deep academic familiarity, strong professional knowledge, behind-the-scenes familiarity 6 Knowledge of secrets and hidden information 7 High-level information, solid understanding of history 8 Almost encyclopedic knowledge, including some deep secrets 9 Rare knowledge only available to a select few 10 Deep secrets others actively try to hide</p>
<p class="calibre1">Note that knowledge of one level comes with knowledge of all the levels with fewer hits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">GAME CONCEPTS // CONTACTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">the course of gameplay if the gamemaster thinks the players have earned it (see p.&nbsp;237). Contacts have a set of regular character stats (see samples on p.&nbsp;211) as well as two special stats: Con- nection and Loyalty. Both ratings range from 1 to 12. Connection measures the contact’s network and their capabilities of pulling information from the people they know. Someone who is new in town and just getting to know people would have a 1; a gang leader might have a 4 or so; a mayor or state politician might have a 6 or 7; a mid-level exec in a multi-national corp might have a 9; fa- mous people who regularly show up in the news sit at 11 and 12. Contacts use their Connection rating to find out how much information they might know about a certain subject. The game- master rolls a Connection + Connection test; the outlines of what they know are on the Legwork Results table. Once the gamemaster has figured out what the contact knows, Loyalty is used to determine how much the contact is willing to share with the player character. The general test is Influence + Charis- ma, with the contact’s Loyalty added as a dice pool modifier. The number of hits is the number of lev- els of knowledge from the Legwork Results table that the contact is willing to share for free. Levels above that will cost the player, usually around 100 nuyen per level, with greater expenses for the high- est levels. The contact can, of course, only share what they know&mdash;just because the character rolled well on their Influence test and the contact is will- ing to share a lot of info does not mean that they suddenly know something they would not have known before. Contacts can also be useful in acquiring diffi- cult-to-find gear. See Availability on p.&nbsp;244.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Statuses Sometimes shadowrunners do things; some- times things are done to them. Either way, they might end up that a status that affects them go- ing forward&mdash;usually temporarily, until either they wear off or something cancels them. Statuses are particular conditions that usually apply to people but sometimes to locations or gear. A status is a compact way of describing the effect things like fire, cold, and confusion have on people. Spells, toxins, and other game elements are the general ways a character or place gets a status, though sometimes the status is an inherent part of a place or piece of gear. The duration of a status is typically described with the spell, toxin, or other effect that causes the status. Some statuses can be canceled by others (for example, the Chilled status cancels the Burn- ing status); those effects are noted in the descrip- tion of each status.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Status Damage Some statuses, such as Burning and Corrosive, come with a damage amount that is inflicted ev- 51 ery round. The damage comes in at the end of each round (giving players and their teammates a chance to do something to remove the Status). It is resisted as normal, by rolling Body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Status List The different statuses used in Shadowrun, Sixth World are described below.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blinded I, II, III Whether it’s flashing lights, some specialized chemical, or the pure force of magic, there are plenty of ways to make it impossible for shadow- runners to see. For the first two levels of this status, characters take a &ndash;3 penalty per level to all tests involving visibility. At the third level, characters automatically fail any tests involving visibility.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Burning # The Burning status is the result of being hit with a flame-based attack. Once the initial blow has done its damage, you have to deal with the con- tinuing heat and flames, and the parts of yourself that may be on fire. The status should be noted with a number that indicates the amount of Physical damage the char- acter must resist each round while the status exists. There are multiple ways to remove this status. You can spend a Major Action and roll an Agility + Reaction (2) test; success means the fire is out and the status is removed. You can also jump into water to remove the status without a roll. If you gain the Wet and/or Chilled status- es, the Burning status is canceled. Similarly, gaining the Burning status cancels the Wet or Chilled status.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chilled When you are truly, damagingly cold, it seeps into your bones and won’t let go, and you can’t move as smoothly and nimbly as you would like. When you are Chilled, you get &ndash;4 to your Initiative Score and &ndash;1 to all dice pools besides Damage Resistance tests. This status cancels and is canceled by the Burn- ing status.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confused # Colors, patterns, and weird ideas swirl around your head, keeping you from being able to focus, which makes your actions uncoordinated and awkward. The number after the status acts as a dice pool penalty on any actions you take.</p>
<p class="calibre1">STATUSES // GAME CONCEPTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Corrosive # Acids, bases, and other caustics eat into your flesh and don’t stop. The ongoing damage from these chemicals is noted with the Corrosive status, which comes with a number after it to denote how much damage the ongoing effect inflicts. The tar- get must resist Physical damage equal to the num- ber each round that the condition exists. Can be removed with certain gear (like baking soda for acids!) and equipment. The Wet status does not necessarily remove it, as some chemi- cals continue burning the skin even after contact with water. The gamemaster can determine when enough water has been applied to remove the chemical in question.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cover I, II, III, IV Whether you hide behind a wall, a dumpster, or a body, Cover is protection from hostile fire. It comes at four levels, indicating how much of a character’s body is protected (one-quarter, one- half, three quarters, or all). A character in Cover gets a +1 bonus per Cover level to their Defense Rating and dice pool to Defense tests. Attacking from Cover requires an extra Minor Action in or- der to get clear enough to take a shot, imposes a &ndash;2 dice pool penalty to your attack at Cover IV, and you cannot gain Edge while attacking from Cover (you can gain it from defending).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dazed One too many thumps to the head, or maybe the solar plexus, leaves the character woozy and unable to act with their normal alacrity. The char- acter reduces their Initiative Score by &ndash;4, and they cannot gain or spend Edge (but they can burn Edge) as long as they have this Status.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Deafened I, II, III Whether you heard a sudden, hugely loud clap, or someone stuffed your ears full of cotton-like mana, sound waves are not getting through so that your brain can tell you what they mean. For the first two levels of this status, characters take a &ndash;3 penalty per level to all tests involving hearing. At the third level, characters automatically fail any tests involving hearing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fatigued I, II, III At its top level, this status is that dreamlike weariness, where your legs are lead and just will. Not. Move. Characters with this status take a &ndash;2 penalty per level to all dice pools besides Damage Resistance tests. Characters move at 5 meters per turn instead of 10 for walking, and 10 instead of 15 for sprinting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Frightened Something has hit your lizard brain, and ratio- nal thought flees. All you have left is fear. Char- acters take a &ndash;4 penalty to dice pools on any tests directed to or defending against the source of the effect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hazed Something has messed up your connection to the astral world, leaving that realm out of your reach. Or worse, if you were already astral, you’re stuck there. A character with this status is unable to move between the astral plane and the physical world. They cannot astrally project or manifest. They may still perceive astrally.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hobbled Any movement on foot, whether by the Move, Sprint, or Avoid Incoming action, is halved (round up).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Immobilized Just what it sounds like! Characters with this status cannot move, though they can take any ac- tions that will function with their feet stuck to the ground. Their Attack Rating is reduced by 3, and they take a &ndash;3 dice pool penalty on all attacks. They cannot use Reaction on their Defense tests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Invisible # The go-to status for sneak thieves. Characters are less visible to living and sentient beings. The number after the status indicates the threshold people must hit on a Perception test to notice the character with this status. Cameras and other inor- ganic methods of visibility detection can see some- one with this status as normal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Invisible (Improved) # The same as Invisibility, but it also affects cam- era and other technological ways of seeing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nauseated Your stomach heaves, your head spins, and you have trouble thinking about anything other than not throwing up. Characters must pass a Body + Willpower (2) test at the start of a combat round. If they fail, they cannot take an action that round. If they succeed, they can act, but they lose a Minor Action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Panicked The drek has hit the fan, and it has splattered everywhere, and you have lost the ability to act</p>
<p class="calibre1">GAME CONCEPTS // STATUSES</p>
<p class="calibre1">in any sort of a coherent fashion. Characters with this status cannot act except to avoid the condition that is causing the Panicked effect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Petrified There is a good reason why you don’t want to be in the wrong end of a basilisk stare, and this is it. The character is essentially turned into solid material. They cannot take any actions, and they get a +10 Armor Rating. This cancels any other damaging statuses the character may have been experiencing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Poisoned # Something wrong has gotten into the charac- ter’s body, and it’s going to mess them up until it works its way through. This status has a damage code after it, with a number and an indication for either Physical or Stun damage. At the end of each combat round when this status exists, the char- acter must resist the indicated damage by rolling Body. The damage decreases by 1 each round. Antidotes, both physical and magical, can re- move this status.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prone One of the classics&mdash;you drop to the ground to get a stable shot and make yourself tougher to shoot. The character’s movement rate is reduced to two meters, and they cannot Sprint. They get a +2 dice pool bonus on Defense Tests against ranged attacks from Medium range or farther, but &ndash;2 on attacks from Close or Near ranges due to their immobility. They also get a &ndash;4 penalty to melee attacks or bow attacks. They increase the Attack Rating of any firearm or projectile weapon (be- sides bows) by 2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Silent # Your ability to make noise is greatly hindered. The number after the status indicates the threshold people must hit on a Perception test to hear the character with this status. Microphones and other inorganic methods of audio detection can pick up sounds of someone with this status as normal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Silent (Improved) # The same as Silent, except microphones and other forms of technology are also affected.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stilled There’s bad news and good news! The bad news is you can’t move. Your feet are absolutely stuck in place. You get a &ndash;10 penalty on your De- fense Rating against incoming attacks (minimum</p>

You also cannot roll Defense tests, but you can roll Damage Resistance tests. 53 The good news is, being Stilled halts any ongo- ing damage or other effects on the character. New damage may be inflicted, but any ongoing effects from it will also be canceled by this status.</li>

You take a &ndash;6 dice pool penalty to Damage Resistance tests against cold and electricity damage.

<p class="calibre1">Zapped A jolt of electrical power has hit you, leaving you fried and scattered. Your muscles aren’t work- ing quite right, either. The character suffers a &ndash;2 to their Initiative Score, the inability to take the Sprint Action, and a dice pool penalty of &ndash;1 on all actions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Character Metatypes Characters in Shadowrun fit one of five meta- types (at least in the core book; more playable metatypes will be introduced in future books). They have variable sizes and bodies, but all of them have the potential to cause some trouble on the streets. Here’s what you need to know about them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dwarfs (homo sapiens pumilionis) • Average height: 1.2 meters • Average weight: 54 kg • Ears: Slightly pointy • Known for: Short size; stocky build; perseverance • Racial qualities: Dwarfs have thermographic vision (p.&nbsp;73) and toxin resistance (p.&nbsp;73).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sixth World dwarfs are often accepted into mainstream society without being fully valued. The taller metatypes seem to be happiest when dwarfs fit the roles they have preconceived for them&mdash; sidekicks, drivers, mechanics, that sort of thing. It doesn’t help that their size helps them squeeze into vehicles that orks, humans, and elves might have difficulty with, ones that trolls couldn’t even</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHARACTER METATYPES // GAME CONCEPTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">consider using. Still, they get work and little direct hate. They’re treated nicely, but they can’t help but feel that they’re being, well, overlooked. 54 Dwarfs across the globe are dedicated to show- ing that they cannot be ignored. Dwarf deckers, street samurai, covert ops specialists, faces, and more are popping up in the international shadows, and others underestimate them at their peril. The lack of heightened antipathy against dwarfs helped them assimilate in human communities bet- ter than other metatypes. This means that they do not have as many of their own enclaves as some of the other metatypes (it also doesn’t help that they don’t have access to whatever stream of revenue the elves tap into build their kingdoms). With the founding of the dwarf-centric Biloxi Technical In- stitute, southern Mississippi in the CAS is becom- ing a dwarf haven. What that will grow into and how that will shape the world is anyone’s guess.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elves (homo sapiens nobilis) • Average height: 1.9 meters • Average weight: 80 kg • Ears: Pointy • Known for: Slender, lithe build; being attrac- tive and knowing it • Racial qualities: Elves have low-light vision (p.&nbsp;72).</p>
<p class="calibre1">GAME CONCEPTS // CHARACTER METATYPES</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps the most infuriating thing about elves to the other metatypes is that you can resent them like hell, and they just won’t care. They have two prosperous nations&mdash;Tír na nÓg (formerly known as Ireland) and Tír Tairngire (in the western part of North America)&mdash;they have people in some of the most powerful positions in the world, and celebri- ties whose MeFeed hits are in the billions. They are envied, not looked down on. But plenty of elves know that this envy does not extend to every elf. If you’re an elf who is not rich, elegant, or graceful, you’re often viewed as a failure, someone who had all the gifts of life handed to them and somehow screwed them up. And it’s not just non- elves who hold this view. Never mind that you might have grown up poor, never mind what obstacles you had to face&mdash;people think you automatically had it easy because you’re an elf. But elf society is not easy to survive. The upper crust can be absolutely ruth- less about enforcing their status quo, labeling those who don’t fit as malcontents and finding ways to cast them aside. The barrens of the major sprawls of the world have plenty of elves who were thrown out because they wouldn’t cave to what society wanted them to be. Their anger could burn the whole earth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Humans (homo sapiens sapiens) • Average height: 1.75 meters • Average weight: 78 kg</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Ears: Rounded • Known for: Average size; average build; freaking out about people who don’t meet their averages • Racial qualities: Humans have no extra ra- cial qualities. As the majority of the sentient beings of the world, humans create existing definitions of “nor- mal,” and then some of them set out to abuse those definitions as hard as they can. These humans know that they lack the pure physical strength and social cohesion of some of the other metatypes, so they shape the world in a way that keeps the in- dividuals they don’t like from ever realizing what they can do, and what they can become. The side effect of this, of course, is that many humans are caught up in the demoralizing machin- ery that the ruling corporate class has assembled, because they don’t fit into this artificial average. They are grist for the mill, people to be chewed up and spat out in the name of greater wealth and power for the people at the top. Because they’re humans, and there are so many of them, who’s go- ing to notice how they’re ground down, and who is going to miss them when they’re gone? The shadows are full of humans who could not find a way to be normal or average.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Orks (homo sapiens robustus) • Average height: 1.9 meters • Average weight: 128 kg • Ears: Pointy</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHARACTER METATYPES // GAME CONCEPTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Known for: Big, powerful physique; tusks; constantly being seen as outsiders • Racial qualities: Orks have low-light vision (p.&nbsp;72) and the Built Tough (1) quality (see p.&nbsp;70) Orks make people nervous, and people don’t like to be nervous. Their tusks, bone structure, and point- ed ears mark them as something altogether else, and their strength and size clearly show the damage they could do. As humans have done for centuries, they address the thing they fear by pushing them aside, keeping orks from building collective strength, and crushing them with the sheer force of numbers. That approach works as long as you can keep fear stoked and have it immobilize the masses. Because if people can move past the fear and start to under- stand the deliberate injustice that has been forced on some groups, they separate themselves from society’s machine, and the number of people used to enforce oppression gets smaller. Oppressors aren’t especial- ly good at developing new solutions to such prob- lems&mdash;they usually just resort to oppressing harder. So while realization of the injustices they deal with is spreading, orks across the Sixth World are prepar- ing for things to get worse so that they can survive and set about the work of making things better. They already have some enclaves carved out for them- selves&mdash;Seattle’s Underground, Atlanta’s Sweetwater Creek, Dharavi in the Indian Union&mdash;and they hope those locales will be the starting points for societies that include orks instead of fearing them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trolls (homo sapiens ingentis) • Average height: 2.5 meters • Average weight: 300 kg • Ears: Slightly pointy, often hidden by horns • Known for: Being so big, you guys. Just huge. And horns. • Racial qualities: Trolls have thermographic vision (p.&nbsp;73), the Built Tough (2) quality (see p.&nbsp;70), and dermal deposits (which pro- vide +1 to trolls’ Defense Rating).</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s not easy to live in a society where you look like the walking embodiment of everyone else’s night- mares. Being two to three times as large as everyone else doesn’t help much, either. It’s not a troll’s world, and most of the other residents of the world aren’t in- clined to change that fact. Who wants to make space for imposing monsters? Trolls are going to have to force their way into a place in the world&mdash;of course, when they force their way in anywhere, they’re inev- itably called vandals and destroyers. A significant number of trolls have looked at the way the deck is stacked against them and de- cided they don’t need to play the rest of the world’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">game anymore. They’ll stand aside and watch the world burn&mdash;and maybe throw on an extra match every now and then. The Black Forest Troll Re- public is one of the most important troll communi- ties in the world, acting as a beacon and vision for what troll society can be while keeping a certain distance from everyone else. Whether they assimi- late or build a higher wall is an open question. Trolls have the most difficult time adapting to other metatypes because their bodies are so differ- ent. It’s more than just the size and the horns&mdash; they have dermal deposits all over their bodies that make knobs, bumps, and other formations. They scrape up furniture and clothing, and make some people think twice about giving a troll a big bear hug. Especially since there are few people who can wrap their arms around a whole troll.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lifestyles Generally, Shadowrun gameplay happens when the characters are on a run, doing the dirty work that earns them a living. That is not, of course, their whole lives&mdash;they have to eat, sleep, go shop- ping, all those sorts of things. While those are es- sential parts of life, they do not make for the most fun role-playing sessions, so games don’t include steps such as searching for homes, signing leases, buying furniture, etc. Instead, each character has a lifestyle that represents the money they spend on</p>
<p class="calibre1">GAME CONCEPTS // LIFESTYLES</p>
<p class="calibre1">food, rent, sundries, and maybe a few luxuries. On occasions, the lifestyle a character has may have a game effect, based on how well their lifestyle pre- pares them for what they need to do. Lifestyles are purchased on a monthly basis (in in-game time), and players can buy them as far in advance as they want. (Many runners don’t buy a lifestyle much more than six months in advance, because they hate to buy a room that they might not be around to enjoy.) Lifestyles are as follows:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Street Cost: Free You have no place to rest your head. Wheth- er you’re crashing on someone’s couch or sleeping out under the stars, you grab rest where you can and food where it’s available. You have no place to store stuff&mdash;if you don’t carry it with you, it likely will be stolen by the time you come back to pick it up. It’s a tough way to live, but it’s cheap! If you haven’t paid for a lifestyle in the current month, then you’re living on the street.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Squatter Cost: 500 nuyen a month The Sixth World has been through a lot&mdash;dis- ease, disaster, warfare, and economic boom and bust. Many of the people who departed this world left space behind them, empty buildings that can be used as long as you can find a way in&mdash;and put up with substandard conditions (buildings fall out of use for a reason). Security is going to be poor to nonexistent&mdash;you can try to get a door to lock, but the wall might be deteriorated enough that would- be burglars will just come in through there instead. Plumbing and heat are just pipe dreams. But if you’re lucky, the place will stay dry, and you might be able to slip some change to your neighbors to keep an eye on your stuff (after all, the discarded people of the world gotta stick together). Squatter food is a step better than street-level, in that you’re not pulling stuff from dumpsters, but it’s mostly soy packets and other flavorless drek&mdash;the modern equivalent of orphan’s gruel.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Low Cost: 2,000 nuyen a month Now we’re getting somewhere. With this life- style, you live in a place that was actually intended to be a residence. Sure, it may have started life as a shipping container, but it was constructed as a home at some point, and it has electricity, running water (though it may be rotated off sometimes during low-supply days), and just enough heat to keep you alive. The doors lock, there’s an official address, and you usually can get the food deliv-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ery guy to bring you some McHugh’s soyburgers. Which, incidentally, you sometimes can afford to eat! Plenty of shadowrunners live at this level, along with the workers of the world that the high- er-ups prefer to ignore whenever possible. 57 Middle Cost: 5,000 nuyen a month The good life is now starting to come in reach. Electricity and water around the clock, police offi- cers that do more than chuckle derisively when you report a crime, flavor injections with most meals, and low odds of being mugged when you’re near your home. Is it spectacular? No, but it’s safe, and that’s a rare enough thing in the Sixth World that many people make all sorts of bargains to gain it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">High Cost: 10,000 nuyen a month Flying on an airplane in economy class means watching trid entertainments that are interrupted every five to ten minutes or so by ads that leave you wondering who the hell buys the stuff on dis- play. Aromatherapy foot massagers? Button-free wine bottle opener? Split-rock backyard fire pit? People with a High lifestyle are the targeted cus- tomers. They have money to spend and space to put the things they buy. They also have a deep need to not let their peers’ homes be more impressive than theirs. They eat well, sleep comfortably, and have trouble understanding people who complain about the state of the world, because it seems just fine to them. Living among them is a sure sign that you’ve made it, but don’t sleep too well&mdash;their tol- erance for interlopers is low, and they have ways of pushing out those who they feel don’t belong. The extra security you pay for may well be needed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Luxury Cost: 100,000 nuyen a month The top. The crème de la crème. People with this lifestyle spend more in a month than squatters and street people earn in several years, or even a lifetime. They do all the things people in the low- er lifestyle categories dream about. They eat real meat regularly. They float on boats in the Caribbe- an and dive off them into azure waters. They stay at hotels where armies of staffers scuttle quickly to meet their needs. They have trid producers hoping to film tours of their homes. Their daily reality is surreal, but any existential angst that might arise can be lulled away with the smoothest liquors, the softest pillows, and the best views money can buy. And remember, the key principle of the Sixth World is that money can buy anything.</p>
<p class="calibre1">LIFESTYLES // GAME CONCEPTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Before we start, let me say thank you for jump- ing into the shadows. We need all the help we can get sticking it to the man, and you’re about to join that noble cause. We hope you have a long and prosperous shadowrunning career! The title of this chapter, Character Creation, is important. It’s not just about generating a portrait or quick sketch. You’re making a character, a per- son who inhabits the shadows and sprawls of the Sixth World. Give them life! We’ll cover how you do this in six steps: • Step One: Define Your Role and History • Step Two: Select Character Priorities • Step Three: Select Qualities • Step Four: Spend Customization Karma • Step Five: Buy Gear • Step Six: Finishing Steps</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step One: Define Your Role and History The very first step in character creation is fig- uring out who you want to be in the shadows. A name and a role are great things to know, but where you came from and what you want are im- portant, too. Those elements will help you see how your character will approach different situations and will give them their own life. The game will be better for it. Your character is going to need a role they can fill as part of a runner team. There are uncountable variations within and between the broad-stroke cat- egories below that can be created, but for those just starting out, we’ll look at four basic roles: arcane spe- cialist, face, street samurai, and technology specialist. If one of those resonated with you, go read that section. If none jumped out, read them all and look</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHARACTER CREATION // DEFINE YOUR ROLE AND HISTORY</p>
<p class="calibre1">a little deeper into each area. Start with the broad strokes, and the fine details will come in later.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arcane Specialist Slinging spells or summoning spirits should se- cure a stable position on any shadowrunner squad. Magic is a big part of what makes the Sixth World so terrifying, while also helping a runner stand out. Sure, that kid might be packing an SMG and has a chip on his shoulder because the Halloweeners just geeked his girl. Thing is, the one over there, the one the Halloweeners just decided was a perfect target for a flaming pumpkin, he’s about to return the fa- vor in the form of a fireball, reminding those punks what happens when you don’t geek the mage first. The options run deep in the magical pool, with full magicians making up the bulk of the badas- ses with their ability to both summon and sling mojo. You can also go the aspected magician route and choose between slinging spells or summoning powerful allies. Then, last but not least, you could mix some adept abilities in with the mystic adept, that can cast, summon, and focus some of that magic inward to fuel their innate powers. You’ll be wreaking havoc while the face of your team, who prefers subtlety, shoots you a little side-eye for being so flashy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Face All talk and no action? Hell yeah! Action gets you shot and bleeding, or knowing what it feels like to have your brain get fried from the inside out by some spellslinger. Talking your way out of as many situations as possible is safer&mdash;espe- cially when you’re the better talker. The face is a charismatic wrecking ball. Others may hurt the megacorps’ bottom line with their mass violence and wanton destruction, but you do all that plus wounding their ego when you stroll right past every security measure they have with a smile, a plausible story, and a clipboard (everyone respects the clipboard). You’ve got social skills and charisma, but that’s not the end of your assets. You’ve got some op- tions. Outside of just the skills and attributes to play the face, along with the awesome roleplaying chops, you can go the road of artificial enhance- ment with cyberware or bioware to complement your aptitude for affability or follow the more ar- cane route and become a social adept or a mage with just the right spells to woo the unwary. No matter what course you take, you can guar- antee that you’ll be out there trying to convince everyone it’s a better idea to just hand over the paydata to you for safekeeping because there are dangerous folks out there who might be thinking of a more violent means of acquisition. All while nonchalantly nodding your head toward the three</p>
<p class="calibre1">meters of meat and steel that is your troll street samurai. Street Samurai 59 The shadows of the Sixth World can be bloody and brutal, and arguments are too often settled with a fist or blade or gun. Violence is the universal language. Predators of every description prowl the back alleys and corporate corridors, from common thugs to skilled professionals. At the top of the heap are the street samurai: fast, lethal warriors fiercely loyal to their code and their latest contract. Out in the shadows, there could be a fight wait- ing around any corner. It might be in your face, down the hall, across the street, or off in the dis- tance, but you have to be ready to meet it. Some fighters prepare for every possibility, others spe- cialize in selected areas. But whether you deal with your enemies at the end of a blade or centered in crosshairs, it all comes down to one thing: Kicking ass. Every fighter needs an advantage&mdash;whether it’s consummate skill, raw strength and agility, top- shelf gear, cyberware implants, innate magic, or a combination of the above. What’s yours? Do you harness the magic of the Sixth World to kick hoop as a physical adept? Gear up with augmentations to become a cybernetic nightmare? Or stay pure and concentrate on skills and attributes rather than spend a fortune on augmentations? After all, you can leave tech to the technology specialist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Technology Specialist There’s a wide spectrum of applications in- side this field, but we mass them together because at the root, you’ll be the team member with the greatest knowledge of tech gear&mdash;be it electronic, computerized, or automotive. You cover the tech side of the shadows. Whether you’re hacking the Matrix as a decker or technomancer, or mastering all things automated as a rigger or dronomancer, you’re an essential part of any runner team. At least any runner team that wants to survive to spend that payday. Hackers use their technical expertise to crack through the firewalls of the world. Whether it’s a commlink, a smartgun, or the main host for Az- technology, hackers look to sleaze or slam their way past electronic security in order to gain control for their team or paydata for their pocketbooks. You can be a decker, hacking with a cyberdeck, or do it with your mind as a technomancer, but either way the world best watch out when you’re darting through the Matrix. Riggers run the world. People see all the auto- mated transportation and construction around the planet and don’t realize that behind every auto- mated network is a rigger just waiting for a chance</p>
<p class="calibre1">DEFINE YOUR ROLE AND HISTORY // CHARACTER CREATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">to hop in and push the limits of the machines. In the shadows, riggers handle transport, logistics, and fire support, all from the comfort of their rig- 60 ger cocoon or from the front seat of their souped- up Chevrolet Phoenix. Just like hacking, rigging doesn’t always take a piece of tech. Specialized technomancers, dubbed “dronomancers” by the streets, weave the web of control with their mind and treat every drone like it’s a friend. Whether hacker or rigger, you’ve got the team’s back&mdash; from logistics to cover fire&mdash;and you don’t get tired working your magic, like the arcane specialists do. And we brought the whole thing around!</p>
<p class="calibre1">History In this step, you want to set up a past for your character without going into their whole detailed biography. You’re welcome to put that together on your own and offer it to your gamemaster as fuel for the story fire, but for the time being we’re just going to run you through a quick series of back- ground points to build your overall story around. Take this step as far as you want&mdash;the deeper you go, the deeper the story.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Where was your character born? Country of origin can be important. It creates a starting point for a life that might continue to revolve around where it started, or could be a nev- er-ending quest to escape that place. In Shadow- run, you also aren’t just limited to countries, as megacorporations also have citizens and territory. Look over some of the world background in The Life You Have Left (p.&nbsp;14), or sit down and talk to your gamemaster to get a feel for the world. Your birthplace could be a scar or a sterling point in your past, but either way it’s something to shape the way you walk, talk, and act toward others who may have similar or different origin stories.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Where was your character raised? Once you answer the first question you know where your character was born, but perhaps equal- ly important, if not more so, is where were you raised. Being raised on the streets, no matter where you are, is a different life from having a consis- tent roof over your head and food on your plate. Was your life spent in the depths of the metroplex, where everything is open all the time and life runs round the clock? Did you get a nice upbringing in a suburban refuge, spending every Saturday morning</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking care of the yard while wishing you lived in the hustle and bustle of the big city because every- thing closed so early? Maybe your character grew up in a place with a skewed definition of “family,” such as a neighborhood run by organized crime or a cult. Neither would leave you totally right in the head. Did you run free and wild through a massive self-sufficient arcology where you and your friends always talked about sneaking onto level 234, but only Billy ever tried and he was never heard from again? Were you isolated at a secluded corp en- clave somewhere, with only a handful of other kids, and everyone knew everyone else? Each option changes who you might have en- countered, what kind of values you were sur- rounded by, how much street savvy you have, what education you had access to, and a plethora of other details you can flesh out to make a deeper character. Remember that you can feel free to change where you were raised from where you were born, as your parents were traded, or extracted, between megacorps. They could have been hired and changed from UCAS to Ares citizens, open- ing doors never before available to you. Or maybe they were cast out of a corp, and suddenly had to live as strangers in a strange land, thrown out of the corporate bosom that used to keep them safe.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Where was your character trained? Who trained you, where is that person/group now, and are they a possible loose end? Are they af- ter you because of some perceived or real betrayal? Were they using you as a test subject, and now you’ve got skills and ’ware to accompany your ever-present feelings of mistrust and betrayal? Are you self-trained and always acting with a chip on your shoulder be- cause no one trusts someone who taught themselves? Looking back and thinking about how you learned what you learned can also be a good way of creating some roleplaying biases. Were you trained by a megacorp and therefore indoctrinated to hate the other megas? Were you trained by a govern- ment and feel like the underdog trying valiantly to protect your former country from enemies foreign and domestic? Were you taught on the street and learned everything the hard way?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Where is your character now? Think about why you run the shadows. Is it the rush? Is it the cash? Is it the only choice you have? Is it revenge? Is it to impress someone? Is it to fight the Man? Is it to regain the favor of your corpo- rate masters? Is it to bring down the megacorpo- rate machine?</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHARACTER CREATION // HISTORY</p>
<p class="calibre1">61</p>
<p class="calibre1">Take a little time to think about your character as a person and develop a sense of motivation. Once you get to the table, every job might not be your cup of soykaf, but you’re part of a team. You’ve got a job to do. When one of those jobs comes around that is right up your dark and shadowy alley, how far will you be willing to go to see it succeed?</p>
<p class="calibre1">How does your character feel about the darker aspects of the world? Before you jump into this section, remember, this is a role-playing game. This is a chance to portray someone you are not, push out and play out some of those heroic fantasies, or dive in and create someone deplorable and see just how long the shadows will tolerate it. But be warned, you are playing this game with other people, and there are lines in the real world we don’t cross. Spouting hateful speech about groups of real humans just because it’s “in character” is never right. There are two other caveats to keep in mind when playing a difficult character:</p>
<ol class="calibre2">
<li class="calibre3">If you decide normal rules of social conduct don’t apply to your character, others may de- cide to forego those rules as well. The game</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre1">world might become a very nasty place for you, without even your teammates support- ing you. When playing a deliberately abra- sive character like that, you need to make sure everyone in your gaming group is on board with what you’re doing. Playing char- acters that ruin the game for others is against the spirit of the game. 2. When you have a gaming group you know well, sometimes you can explore the darker sides of a character, but that tends to go less well with new groups, or groups at conven- tions. When playing with people you don’t know, it’s generally a good idea to not bring the darker baggage into the game with you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shadowrun is a dark setting, and some sort of antisocial behavior will happen in the game. It’s important, though, to consider specific areas in terms of what your character is comfortable with and what the group is comfortable with. Here are some areas to think about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wetwork Killing for money, and even killing in general, is serious. In many role-playing games, it’s just a part of the action and no one thinks twice about</p>
<p class="calibre1">HISTORY // CHARACTER CREATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. Here, we ask players to be more than indis- criminate slaughtering machines and truly con- sider the efforts and actions they undertake and 62 look at the aftermath. Let’s look at just a few is- sues involved. Murder, no matter where it is, is illegal. Kill- ing someone, even in self-defense, can lead to le- gal battles and investigations. No runner wants anyone digging into their life any deeper than necessary. Sure, you killed that Halloweener to protect yourself and those around you, but how is it you live in this nice doss and yet report no income? In Shadowrun, deaths are investigated, and magic makes tracking anyone injured at the fight possible, if there’s a good ritual sorcerer on the payroll. That means the back-alley brawl you get into and finish by putting a bullet in their brainpan to make a point could easily lead to a Lone Star SWAT team kicking in the door of your doss. What about the other Halloweeners? You killed one of theirs. They aren’t going to let that stand. It’s not just psychotic gangers who feel that way, either. A stray round or explosion kills a civilian. You decide to kill the guards to leave no witnesses. A job requires you to kill someone’s wife or a cor- porate executive. All those people are connected to other people. The civilian could be a cop’s sister. One of those guards could be the son of an exec- utive with enough power and reach to come af- ter you. That wife was the daughter and grandson of Consigliere Anthony Gianelli, and the Family takes care of their own. That executive was having a relationship with his assistant, who’s gone mad with grief and still has access to the boss’ accounts for a few days before the corp shuts them down. There are a lot of reasons to be worried and paranoid in Shadowrun, and building them up ev- ery time you pull a trigger, cast a spell, or drop an elevator car drives those worries to the point of debilitating paranoia. Especially when your job re- quires you to meet people you don’t know in dark clubs and alleys. You can never be sure when the reaper will come to collect what you have sown. Even without the paranoia, the act of taking an- other person’s life takes its toll on the mind. How each group wants to treat that issue should be dis- cussed among the players.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Drugs and Alcohol We’re not talking about the casual use, here. What we’re talking about is involving your char- acter in the world of drugs or taking their use of alcohol to an extreme. Addiction is a serious is- sue, and while it comes into gameplay as a set of rules, numbers, and possible penalties, it exists in the world as a real struggle. Characters who are addicted think differently than those who aren’t. Acts that would be unacceptable suddenly become</p>
<p class="calibre1">the gateway to the next high, and rather than trep- idatiously opening said gate, an addict might fly through screaming just to get to the goal. Beyond the issues involved with supplying ad- dicts with their cravings, the act of joining in drug trafficking can raise other issues. Runners aren’t al- ways hired to raid corporate labs. Sometimes the job offer comes from a local gang leader who needs his shipment protected by someone with a solid street rep. Or it could be protecting the head of a smuggling ring that is bringing in billions of nuyen worth of betameth every month. Are you then guilty by association for the many deaths it causes? Determining a stance here could very well af- fect your view when a job offer comes along and you feel inclined to decline for moral reasons and ignore the chuckling of your morally devoid co- workers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trafficking Runners deal with moving and protecting all sorts of illicit goods, including human beings. Ex- tracting a corp scientist to go work for another corp is one thing, but running protection for a van that you are pretty sure is full of sex slaves on their way to a Yakuza bunraku parlor is a whole other ball game. When the time comes, will your char- acter take the big cash that can come with such work, or will they make a moral stand? Even more often, these are the jobs you get be- cause you didn’t ask enough questions, didn’t ask questions at all, or felt the pressure to make a buck and accepted the job before you got the details. Once you rip off the cover of some of these jobs to find the hidden maggots that were festering in Mr.&nbsp;Johnson’s request, will you walk away and risk the hit to your rep&mdash;and possibly the hit team sent to snip off loose ends? In the world of Shadowrun, you play as the downtrodden. Do you cling to your place above by keeping those below you down? It’s a sad and mo- rose option, but it exists. Or are you one of those who think everyone who has ever been stepped on, beat down, taken advantage of, or crushed under the weight of megacorporate control deserves a chance to fight back? Do you see them as part of the army for upending the megacorporate mono- lith that has seized control of the world?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Racism and Injustice Like our world, Shadowrun has racism, though in the game it is usually based on differences in metatypes rather than skin color. Its existence in the Sixth World gives characters the chance to be heroes and stand up for those who are looked down on for their appearance. Social divisions such as race and class are used by the corps to divide people, pitting them against one another instead of</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHARACTER CREATION // HISTORY</p>
<p class="calibre1">having them think about the extreme inequity that shapes their daily lives. How will your character react to this? Are they helped or hurt by the status quo, and how do they feel about that? Will they look at how they can contrib- ute to change, or will they be complicit in the ongoing issues? Do they accept biases or question them? Will they be aggressive in the approach they choose? Do they take jobs, finish them, and then turn around and use the money to go help out and make a difference from the shadows? Knowing where you stand isn’t just about morality and justice, it’s about paranoia, diligence, resistance, suffering, and resilience. These are sensitive issues and should be discussed with other group members. People’s boundaries and identities should be respected. The shadows are dark places, but they cannot exist without the light, and players can decide how much light they should shine.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Two: Select Character Priorities With background issues covered, it’s time to start slotting some numbers. The Priority System offers a quick and broad-stroke method of making your shadowrunner. The big picture is shaped by your choices on the Priority Chart. There are five priority rows (A&ndash;E), and five categories to assign priorities: Metatype, Attributes, Skills, Magic/Res- onance, and Resources. Give one priority to each category (i.e., pick one option in each row, and only one per column). These choices will give you the basic components of your character. Selections don’t need to be made in order. Choosing what’s most important to you first or least important to you first are equally valid op- tions, and adjustments may need to be made as you progress. We present them in the order we have them on the chart, but you can choose them in any order your remarkable heart desires. Here is a rundown of each column of the table.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Metatype (Adjustment Points) Now that you know what you want to do, let’s decide what wrapper you’re going to toss on. Shadowrun is a mix of high fantasy and dystopian cyberpunk, the former of which means you’ve got some race options other than just human. Different metatypes are available at each pri- ority with a variable number of points to use to buy Edge, boost specific attributes for that meta- type, and/or enhance Magic or Resonance. Certain metatypes, namely humans and elves, don’t appear at the highest Priorities. You can get an overview of the metatypes on p.&nbsp;53.</p>
<p class="calibre1">DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PLAY The rules as described in this chapter describe the basic level of play for Shadowrun, but that doesn’t mean everyone wants to start at that level. Some people may want to push their runners a little ahead, so they can start with more experienced, skilled characters. Others may enjoy the challenge of starting with less-skilled charac- ters and see if they can make them survive long enough to become street legends. Making low-level street runners is simple&mdash;select your priorities as normal from the Priority Table, but then apply the values from one row lower than the one you chose (e.g., if you chose Priority B for attributes, you’d actually gain the values from Priority C, which is 12 at- tribute points). Since you can’t go any lower than row E, that means you would have two selections from that row. On the other end is a prime runner. If you want to start at this advanced level, simply double the amount of customization Karma (see p.&nbsp;66) from 50 to 100. Get that spent and start living the prime life!</p>
<p class="calibre1">The selection you make here is based not just on metatype but on the accompanying number of ad- justment points you will use to increase the values of certain attributes. Adjustment points are used to modify Magic/Resonance, purchase Edge, and en- hance the special racial attributes. Each metatype (except for human) has two or more attributes that can be outside the base 1&ndash;6 range. These are the special racial attributes, and they can be increased with adjustment points from this column. The Edge attribute deserves some special at- tention. Edge can be extremely valuable, helping snatch victory from defeat. Points to increase Edge come from here, so take advantage of it! For more information on Edge and its uses, see p.&nbsp;44.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Attributes As described on p.&nbsp;37, attributes fall into three different groups: Physical, Mental, and Special. All metahuman characters have a rank in each of their Physical and Mental attributes, but some may not have ranks in the Special attributes. Baseline attributes range start at 1 and can go up to 6. That range is modified by metatype and/ or chosen qualities. The Metatype Attributes table provides the ranges of the attributes for each meta- type and the particular qualities certain metatypes gain as a free bonus. Descriptions of qualities start on p.&nbsp;70. If player characters ever have a Physical or Mental attribute adjusted to 0 through magic or some other effect, they collapse, as either their body or mind has lost some critical functioning. They are nonfunctional until at least 1 rank is re- stored in that attribute. During character creation, only one attribute may be at the maximum for the selected metatype.</p>
<p class="calibre1">SELECT CHARACTER PRIORITIES // CHARACTER CREATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">priority table 64</p>
<p class="calibre1">Troll (1)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Priority Selection Examples Tom and Alyson are going to make characters in a game they’ll be in together, so they want them to complement each other. Tom’s going with an elf spellcaster to take care of the magic side of things, and Alyson wants to make a human street samurai to bust suckas in the face. Tom wants to be an elf, so he can’t take Priority A from the metatype column, because it doesn’t have an elf option. Priority A has the highest values in the Magic or Resonance column, so that’s what he selects. He wants enough attribute</p>
<p class="calibre1">metatype attributes table</p>
<p class="calibre1">points to make his Willpower and Logic high enough to resist Drain, and also to have points to spread around to other areas so he can be capable in running, dodging, and maybe throw- ing a punch. So he takes Attributes for Priority B. Priority C in Skills will help him get the Sorcery, Conjuring, and Athlet- ics skills he wants (with some Perception and other odds and ends thrown in), while Priority D in metatype will let him be an elf and give him a few points for Edge and Magic adjust- ment. That means Priority E will be resources&mdash;a mere 8,000 nuyen, but Tom doesn’t figure to be spending much on gear. So his choices look like this:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Metatype Body Agility Reaction Strength Willpower Logic Intuition Charisma Edge Human 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;7 Racial Qualities: None Dwarf 1&ndash;7 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;5 1&ndash;8 1&ndash;7 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 Racial Qualities: Toxin Resistance, Thermographic Vision Elf 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;7 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;8 1&ndash;6 Racial Qualities: Low-light Vision Ork 1&ndash;8 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;8 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;5 1&ndash;6 Racial Qualities: Low-light Vision, Built Tough 1 Troll 1&ndash;9 1&ndash;5 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;9 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;6 1&ndash;5 1&ndash;6 Racial Qualities: Dermal Deposits, Thermographic Vision, Built Tough 2</p>
<p class="calibre1">Priority A: Magic or Resonance Priority B: Attributes Priority C: Skills Priority D: Metatype Priority E: Resources</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alyson has different priorities. She knows her Meta- type column will be C, D, or E&mdash;probably one of the latter two, since she doesn’t think she’ll need many adjustment points. She also knows she needs more money than Tom for some first-class ’ware. She doesn’t think she needs the same attribute spread as Tom, and she wants a fair amount of skills&mdash;Firearms, Close Combat, Stealth, Perception, and Athletics will all be worthwhile, and she might throw in some Biotech for healing purposes. The good news is she</p>
<p class="calibre1">needs neither Magic nor Resonance, so that column will be Priority E.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Priority A: Skills Priority B: Resources Priority C: Attributes Priority D: Metatype Priority E: Magic or Resonance</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be honest, she’s a little concerned that the 14 attribute points from Priority C will be a little thin, but she figures the extra Karma for customization and a negative quality or two will help fill in any gaps she might have. Some of the elements mentioned here, including extra Kar- ma and negative qualities, will be covered later in the chapter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHARACTER CREATION // SELECT CHARACTER PRIORITIES</p>
<p class="calibre1">Skill It’s now time to define what you can do, or at least do well. Skills are used to perform any and all challenging actions or even simple actions when under duress in the world of Shadowrun. Consider what your chosen place on the team requires, and then consider some of the character’s broader his- tory when choosing where to put your points. During character creation, skills can be pur- chased up to rank 6 (7 with the Aptitude Qual- ity). Only one skill can be put at that maximum level (6 or 7). During gameplay, those skills can reach 9 (10 with the Aptitude Quality). Skill points from the priority table are spent on a one- for-one basis&mdash;each point spent adds a rank to a selected skill. Descriptions and rules for what is covered by each skill is located in the Skills chapter (p.&nbsp;92). You can also select specializations (see p.&nbsp;92 for description) in character creation. When using the Priority Chart, a specialization costs the same as one rank of a skill. You cannot acquire more than one specialization in a skill at character creation, and you cannot acquire an expertise.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic/Resonance If you don’t want your character to have Magic or Resonance, you get to skip this section, but know that it’s out there. By 2080, everyone knows that magic and technomancy exist. Their views and opinions of it vary and contain a different subject matter altogether, but that’s work for another section. Using this column, you choose whether your character will have a Magic or Res- onance attribute. Let’s look at the options and go over the parts of this step. There are five options in this column: full, aspected, adept, technomancer, and mundane. Mundane is only available at Priority E, so let’s cover that real quick. Choosing to be mundane means no access to Magic or Resonance. Simple as that. Your spe- cial attribute points will have to be spent elsewhere, but if you don’t want Magic or Resonance, this is probably the best use of Priority row E. Each selection beyond that provides a base Resonance or Magic attribute be- tween 1 and 5, generally differing based on the type of character you are building (aspected magicians get an extra point of Magic to compensate for their oth- er limitations; see p.&nbsp;159). These ratings can be increased using adjustment points from the Metatype column or using Kar- ma in the Final Touches stage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">skill list Astral, Athletics, Biotech, Close Combat, Con, Conjur- ing, Cracking, Electronics, Enchanting, Engineering, Exot- 65 ic Weapons, Firearms, Influence, Outdoors, Perception, Piloting, Sorcery, Stealth, Tasking</p>
<p class="calibre1">Full magicians gain access to the full range of magical abilities, spellcasting, summoning, and en- chanting, as well as offering full access to the astral plane with both astral perception (p.&nbsp;159) and as- tral projection (p.&nbsp;160). During character creation, they get a number of spells or rituals equal to their Magic x 2&mdash;the rating used for that calculation is the Magic in the Priority table, not as altered with any points, Karma, or any other adjustments. Aspected magicians are only able to utilize one of the three aspects of magic: spellcasting (Sorcery), summoning (Conjuring), or enchanting (Enchanting).</p>
<p class="calibre1">SELECT CHARACTER PRIORITIES // CHARACTER CREATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">They can access to the astral plane with astral percep- tion and projection. Sorcerers select a number of free spells or rituals equal to their Magic x 2&mdash;as before, 66 the rating used is the Magic in the Priority table, not as altered with any points, Karma, or adjustments. Adepts focus all of their magic inward, fueling their talents with their innate ability to pull mana in rather than channel it outward. Due to this physi- cal connection to their magic, they cannot astrally project and only gain the ability to astrally perceive through training. Adepts have a pool of points equal to their Magic (as listed in the Priority table, before any adjustments) that they use to purchase adept powers. For more information on adepts, see p.&nbsp;156. Mystic adepts are a blend of inward and out- ward magic. They are capable of casting spells, summoning spirits, and enchanting items, but they also channel a portion of their magic inward to fuel adept talents. They are not able to astrally project due to the anchoring effect of their adept powers, but they can astrally perceive. They must split their Magic between spells and adept powers. They first purchase adept powers up to a maxi- mum of their Magic attribute then multiply the remaining Magic by 2 to determine their starting number of spell choices. Again, this uses the Mag- ic value in the Priority table, not as adjusted with Karma or adjustment points. Technomancers have a special connection to the Matrix, which is measured in an attribute called Resonance. They have the ability to create pro- grams and sprites on the fly along with the ability to manipulate the energies of the Matrix to bend it to their will. When they select their Resonance Priority, they also select a number of complex forms equal to Resonance x 2 (using the Resonance figure from the Priority table, not the number as adjusted).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Resources This one is straightforward. The number in the column is the cash you have to buy those things you’re going to need to rule the shadows. This isn’t your only chance to get money, but it’s the biggest. If you need more cash, in the Finishing Touches section of this chapter you will find a place to spend a little more Karma for cash. The exchange rate is 2,000 nuyen per Karma, or 5,000 with the In Debt quality. The money will be spent on gear, which is detailed in the Gear chapter (p.&nbsp;244).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Three: Select Qualities This step can be done at any point after you’ve developed a little backstory and you know some- thing about the character you’re going to bring to life. Look through the Qualities section (p.&nbsp;70) and start a list of things you think fit your character</p>
<p class="calibre1">concept. You can pick based on mechanics, but it might be more fun to design a concept, pick quali- ties that suit it, and see what happens! Once you have the list, tally up the costs, pos- itive and negative. The limit on qualities at char- acter creation is this: You can’t select more than six total qualities at character creation, and the net bonus Karma cannot be more than 20.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Four: Spend Customization Karma Every runner gets to wrap up their creation process with a little touch of reality. After the original points are spent, it’s time to think about a little development. Each character receives 50 Karma to make a little move forward. The points are spent on skill or attribute advancement, as well as additional funds to get those last gear pieces you might have missed or an additional quality (though the limit of six qualities still ap- plies). See Character Advancement (p.&nbsp;68) for the price of buying these advances. Remember that you can spend Karma to buy cash for the next step at a rate of 2,000 nuyen per point of Karma, or 5,000 with the In Debt quality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Five: Buy Gear By this point you should have a pool of nuyen, both from your Resources selection on the Priority Table and from any Karma you turned into cash. You can buy goods for your runner from the Gear chapter at the price listed in the book. Make sure you look at the Availability rating of any gear you buy; at character creation, you cannot purchase any illegal gear with a rating 7 or higher (see p.&nbsp;244 for definitions of availability).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Six: Finishing Steps Contacts Contacts are a pivotal part of shadowrunning. Everyone knows a few folks they can reach out to for gear, a little support, or info. These individ- uals are controlled by the gamemaster and live their own lives while the runners are out shooting people in the face for money. When needed, you just pick a contact and tell the gamemaster you’re reaching out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHARACTER CREATION // SELECT QUALITIES</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each contact has a pair of ratings: Connec- tion and Loyalty. Connection usually determines the detail and level of info or rarity of the gear they can get, while Loyalty determines wheth- er they’re going to turn around and sell similar data on you, tip a gang off to a well-equipped runner team, or roll over when Knight Errant kicks down their door. The more loyal, the less likely they are to sell you out. During the game you gain contacts through jobs and interactions with the citizens of the Sixth World. During character creation, you have a total of Charisma x 6 points to spend on Connection and Loyalty ratings for your contacts, and at this point, neither rating can be higher than the character’s Charisma.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowledge and Language Skills The things you know shape who you are&mdash; maybe you’re a pop-culture expert, or elven wine aficionado, or an expert on unsolved math equa- tions. Knowledge skills add depth and options to your character. Characters get a certain number of free Knowledge and Language skills at charac- ter creation (for more information on these skills, see p.&nbsp;97) equal to their Logic, plus one free Na- tive Language. Characters can buy additional lev- els of Language skills as if it were an additional Knowledge skill, but only one Native-level Lan- guage skill is allowed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Final Calculations Once you’ve made all the purchases and adjust- ments, there are a few calculations to make to get your character polished up. Here they are!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Attack Rating (AR) In combat, the Attack Rating is a measure of the accuracy, efficiency, and basic smoothness of the attack. Usually, it comes from a weapon, but sometimes you’re attacking with your bare hands, so you need an Attack Rating. It’s Reac- tion + Strength at the Close range, with no rating at the other ranges (see Attack Rating/Range, p.&nbsp;108). Some qualities and gear may affect this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Defense Rating (DR) Defense Rating is a measure of how well pre- pared you are to take a blow, or to encourage it to miss you. It is used in virtually all combat situations. To generate it, add your Armor rat- ing to Body. Some qualities and gear may affect this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Initiative Initiative is used to determine who goes first in combat. Add your Reaction + Intuition for your base, then write how many Initiative Dice you have. You start with a default of 1; this may be increased by augmentations. It looks like this when written: 9 + 1D6</p>
<p class="calibre1">Attribute-Only Tests Most tests in Shadowrun are a combination of skill + attribute, but there are a few fixed at- tribute-only tests that come up often enough that characters should make a note of them so they’re ready to be used.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Composure (Willpower + Charisma) When the stress is running hot, the gamemas- ter can call for a test to see if you keep your cool. The gamemaster sets the threshold, and the player makes the roll to see if they stay engaged or start freaking out. Note that repeated exposure to cer- tain types of situations reduces the need for Com- posure tests in those situations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Judge Intentions (Willpower + Intuition) Sometimes you just need a roll to get a read on someone. The Judge Intentions test is just that. Once you’ve had enough time to get a read on someone (as judged by the gamemaster), you can make a roll to help fill in your basic attitude and feelings toward the target. Just remember that a good part of Mr.&nbsp;Johnson’s training is dedicated to getting you to trust them when you shouldn’t.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Memory (Logic + Intuition) Most of us don’t remember our lives with one hundred percent clarity. We’re influenced by the mood at the time we formed a memory, the cur- rent mood, the presence or absence of memorable stimuli, or even slight oddities in the details. Then you have the tricks our mind plays in distorting memories to make us the heroes of our own sto- ry, and things get really weird. When it’s time to make a withdrawal from the memory bank, the gamemaster sets a threshold based on the age and complexity of the information, and you can roll to determine whether or not you recall the infor- mation you want. It may be about remembering a face, recalling a critical piece of information, pull- ing up a detail from the past that will help you understand what’s happening in front of you right now, or some other mental feat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lift/Carry (Body + Willpower) As any professional powerlifter or crossfit champ will tell you, it’s not all in the muscles. You need the will to persevere in order to pull that little extra</p>
<p class="calibre1">FINISHING STEPS // CHARACTER CREATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">bit for the big efforts. Whether it’s pulling a com- rade out of danger or flipping a car to cover your getaway, this is going to be the roll when there’s a 68 question on whether or not it can be done. Charac- ters can lift [(Strength x Strength) x 10] kilograms naturally; if they need to raise the weight over their head, the multiplier drops to 5. Making a Lift/Carry test increases your effective Strength by 1 per net hit. It also does 1 Stun damage, resisted by Body. The damage increase by +1 each combat round you continue holding or carrying the weight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Starting Nuyen Do you have any cash left over from charac- ter creation? Great. That’s your starting nuyen. If it’s more than 5,000 nuyen, then go back and buy something else (including buying a Lifestyle), be- cause you can’t go into the game with more than that. If it’s less, then plunge ahead and get ready to earn some more! Character Advancement Characters use Karma they earn on runs (as well as bonus Karma gained in the character cre- ation process) to increase their various abilities. The costs for advancements in all categories are outlined in the Advancement Costs table, along with suggested training times. The time it takes to raise any given ability is truly only suggest- ed&mdash;the actual time used is up to the gamemaster, with times best fitting the story they want to tell, but we offer the listed times to create a general consensus. During those periods of time, it is ex- pected that the runner is spending at least four hours each day dedicated to their efforts. Given eight hours for sleep and four hours for miscella- neous life activities, that leaves twelve hours, and therefore three different advancements that can be worked on simultaneously.</p>
<p class="calibre1">advancements costs</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE KARMA COST TRAINING TIME Active skills 5 x new rank (new rank) months Specializations 5 1 month Expertise 5 2 months Attributes 5 x new rank (new rank x 2) months Knowledge skills 3 1 month</p>
<p class="calibre1">Attributes Whether physical or mental, attributes are in- creased with exercise. It may look like gym time or a rigorous series of Matrix puzzles, but each attribute needs to be worked on to make it better. Spend 5 Karma x new level to advance. This needs to be done for each rank of advancement, so if you want to change an attribute from 4 to 6, you need to pay 25 Karma for rank 5 (5 x 5) and 30 Karma for rank 6 (6 x 5), for a total of 55 Karma. See the Attribute and Skill Advancement table for the costs to rise from one rank to another.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Active Skills Any active skill requires training. This can be range time, dojo time, shop time, driving time, lodge or circle time, or a myriad of other times. You just need to put in the time and effort to see the results and improvements you want. Due to these space and training needs, the gamemaster may also put a price tag on the work to represent range member- ships, space rental, or other incidental costs. Fifty nuyen per month is a good base, but gamemasters can adjust according to their campaign, and char- acters can mitigate those costs by getting help from teammates or contacts. You have to spend 5 Karma x new rank to ad- vance. This needs to be done for each rank of ad- vancement, so if you want to change a skill from 4 to 6, you need to pay 25 Karma for rank 5 (5 x 5) and 30 Karma for rank 6 (6 x 5), for a total of 55 Karma. See the Attribute and Skill Advancement table for the costs to rise from one rank to another.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowledge Skills Through study, schooling, Matrix courses, or just sitting down in a library on a daily basis, you learn. Gaining Knowledge skills requires study. The one-month timeframe assumes concerted study, as described earlier in this section. Trying to learn on the fly, fitting in study when the character has time, makes the time frame 3 months. New Knowledge skills cost 3 Karma.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Specializations and Expertise Like active skills, specializations and expertise (p.&nbsp;92) take time to learn. While a specialization can be learned for any skill, there are two prereq- uisites for an expertise: first, you need to have a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Purchase positive quality Eliminate negative</p>
<p class="calibre1">2 x normal cost 1 week</p>
<p class="calibre1">specialization in that area; and second, your re- lated skill rank needs to be at least 5. This means</p>
<p class="calibre1">quality 2 x normal cost 1 week</p>
<p class="calibre1">New spell 5 per spell 1 week New complex form 5 per form 1 week Initiation 10 + Initiate Grade (Grade +1) months Submersion 10 + Submersion Level (Level + 1) weeks</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the months spent gaining a specialization and expertise are concerted training on top of the edu- cation and skill you already have. You cannot gain an additional specialization in a skill until you have converted the first one into an expertise, and the most you can ever have in a skill is one spe-</p>

Current</p>
<p class="calibre1">cialization and one expertise. Specializations and expertise both cost 5 Karma.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Qualities Qualities can be obtained in two ways after char- acter creation; they can be purchased, or they can be earned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Purchased Purchasing a positive quality requires spending twice the normal Karma cost. New negative quali- ties cannot be “purchased” in an effort to get more Karma after character creation, but negative quali- ties the character already has can be eliminated by paying twice the base Karma bonus.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Earned Both positive and negative qualities may be earned through role-playing. Maybe a character makes several wildly successful juryrigging tests in a row, so the gamemaster feels they have earned the Juryrigger quality. Or maybe the character has taken an orphaned child under their wing, earning them the Dependents quality. Gamemaster discre- tion holds sway here, but gamemasters should be careful to assign qualities that make gameplay more fun for everyone involved&mdash;loading a character with too many free positive qualities can make one character too overpowered so that the other players have less fun, while saddling a character with nega- tive qualities too easily can be frustrating for them. Work to provide a balance of challenge and fun.</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT // CHARACTER CREATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">New Spells Learning a new spell requires a spell formula, which generally can be purchased from a talismon- ger. You also need access to a magical lodge (see p.&nbsp;129), some time to study and practice the intricacies of the casting, and a final ritual to lock the spell into the spellcaster’s aura. After about a week of study, (see p.&nbsp;131), the spell is ingrained into the spellcaster’s mind well enough they’ll never forget it, while the ritual cre- ates the bond needed to pull the energies of that spell from the astral plane. The spell costs 5 Karma.</p>
<p class="calibre1">New Complex Forms Learning new technomancer complex forms has not yet become mainstream. In order to learn a new complex form, you need access to the base code, a host to work on, and the time to get the in- tricacies of the formation down. Once the process is started in a host, it needs to be completed in that same host. At the end of the week, the base code is absorbed into the Resonance of the technomancer, becoming a part of what they do in the Matrix. New complex forms cost 5 Karma.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Initiation/Submersion While vastly different in appearance within the Sixth World, the processes of initiation and submersion both require intense time and effort. The details of each are located in their respective chapters along with the advantages and other abilities gained through the process. For purpos- es of Karma and time, characters start at Level 0 and grow from there. Initiation costs 10 Karma + the initiation/submersion level.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Qualities These are the possible qualities you can use in Shadowrun, Sixth World. Positive qualities have a Karma cost that you must pay in character creation; negative qualities come with a Karma bonus that you can spend during the creation process. Qualities can be obtained after character creation, as discussed in the Character Advance- ment section (p.&nbsp;68).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Positive Qualities Ambidextrous You are equally adept at using either your right or left side. Whether shooting a gun, throwing a grenade, or kicking a ball, you can switch it up with the best of them. • Cost: 4 Karma • Game Effect: No penalty for off-hand weap- on use (see p.&nbsp;110).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Analytical Mind You are a master problem solver. You can analyze information to help deduce solutions, while separating useful bits from the distractions and noise. • Cost: 3 Karma • Game Effect: You gain a bonus Edge when you make any Logic-based test.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aptitude (Skill) The best look up to you. You have the natural potential to be even better than the best in a par- ticular skill. • Cost: 12 Karma • Game Effect: Your skill maximum for the se- lected skill is 10, instead of 9, and your max- imum starting rank is 7, instead of 6.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Astral Chameleon Your aura never seems to stabilize for very long. You have the ability to blend in with the astral en- vironment around you and make it harder to iden- tify and read your aura and astral signature. • Cost: 9 Karma • Game Effect: Characters receive &ndash;2 dice on tests to recognize your aura or astral signa- ture. Your astral signature fades in half the normal time (see p.&nbsp;159).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blandness You are the least interesting person in the world. You’re average height, average weight, average build, average everything. Nothing at all about you tends to stand out, and that can be ex- tremely useful. • Cost: 8 Karma • Game Effect: Characters take a &ndash;2 penalty on Memory tests (p.&nbsp;67) to remember if they have seen you before, and the threshold on tests to notice if you are following or observ- ing them is increased by 1. If the character acquires something permanent and distinc- tive&mdash;obvious, unusual cyberware, a unique tattoo, that sort of thing&mdash;they lose this qual- ity. If they acquire something temporarily dis- tinctive, such as an extreme hairdo, the effects are negated until those changes are reversed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Built Tough (1 to 4) You’re built like a brick drekhouse. You’re pret- ty good at taking a few extra hits before the lights go out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHARACTER CREATION // QUALITIES</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Cost: 4 Karma per level • Game Effect: You have a number of addi- tional boxes on your Physical Condition Monitor equal to the rank of this quality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Catlike You have an innate grace usually seen only in the genus Felis that translates into smooth move- ments and a propensity for always landing on your feet&mdash;literally, if not figuratively. • Cost: 12 Karma • Game Effect: You gain a bonus Edge on all tests for balance, falling, and landing safely. Note the rules in the Preventing Edge Abuse section, p.&nbsp;45.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dermal Deposits You have calciferous deposits growing on or through your flesh, making you tougher and a little rough around the edges. Literally. • Cost: 7 Karma • Game Effect: You gain 1 level of natural Ar- mor. Your Unarmed Melee attacks have a Base Damage Value of [(STR/2) + 1]P.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Double-Jointed Through practice or genetics, you’ve managed to make most of the joints in your body bend be- yond normal metahuman ranges. Your hands nar- row to as small as your wrists, your shoulders ro- tate and bend in every direction, your body folds neatly in half both forward and backward, and you can rotate your head to look behind you with- out turning your shoulders, just to name a few of your neatest party tricks. • Cost: 12 Karma • Game Effect: You gain a bonus Edge on all tests involving grappling, escaping bonds, flexibility, or fitting into tight spaces. Note the rules on Preventing Edge Abuse, p.&nbsp;45.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Elemental) Resistance Through genetics or training, you have devel- oped a powerful resistance and tolerance for cer- tain forms of damaging energy (or lack of energy, in the case of cold). • Cost: 12 Karma • Game Effect: When choosing this quality, se- lect an elemental form of damage (p.&nbsp;109). When attacked with a weapon or spell (in- cluding unarmed combat by a spirit) that does this form of damage, gain a point of Edge before making your Defense test.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Exceptional (Attribute) Whether it’s being a powerhouse, taking a hit from a troll, holding your synthahol, ducking a fast right, holding that inside turn, selling coal in Newcastle, or making a cat look clumsy, you’re just naturally built to be better. • Cost: 12 Karma • Game Effect: Select a Physical or Mental at- tribute. The character’s attribute maximum (but not current rank) for the chosen attri- bute increases by 1 to a maximum of 10. This quality can only be purchased once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First Impression You know how to make an entrance and make that first meeting the best meeting. Your wit, charm, and subtle flattery put everyone you meet off their guard and let you make the most of a first encounter. • Cost: 12 Karma • Game Effect: You gain 2 Edge for Social Tests during your first meeting with anyone, and both your Heat and Reputation are ig- nored for this first encounter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Focused Concentration (1 to 3) You know how to compartmentalize your mind and keep hold of arcane and emergent manipula- tions without straining yourself. • Cost: 12 Karma per level • Game Effect: You can sustain multiple spells or complex forms without penalty. For each level, you can sustain 1 additional spell or complex form without suffering the associ- ated penalty. The spell cannot have a modi- fied Drain Value of 7 or greater.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gearhead If it’s meant to move but currently isn’t moving so well, you know how to get it back into tip-top shape in a jiffy. • Cost: 10 Karma • Game Effect: You gain an Edge on Repair tests for any vehicle and can spend Edge during downtime to make Extended Repair tests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Guts It’s not a lack of fear, just a lack of cowardice! You can stand up to the most intimidating oppo- nents and hold your tongue under the toughest in- terrogations. • Cost: 12 Karma • Game Effect: You gain an Edge when re- sisting Intimidation or effects that cause the Frightened status.</p>
<p class="calibre1">QUALITIES // CHARACTER CREATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardening Get clipped by IC and other personas enough times in the Matrix, and you can start to build defenses against it. Your physical form actually helps absorb some of the injuries coming at your Matrix persona. • Cost: 10 Karma • Game Effect: You gain a bonus Edge when making Matrix Damage Resistance tests. If you do not use that point of Edge immedi- ately on the Damage Resistance test, it goes away. When struck by any damage in the Ma- trix, you can convert up to two boxes to Stun Damage, rather than Matrix damage, protect- ing your persona at the cost of yourself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">High Pain Tolerance Pain is but an illusion of the mind. Either that, or you were born with congenital analgesia. Either way, you don’t suffer the ill effects of injury and pain like others. Cost: 7 Karma • Game Effect: When wounded, reduce your wound penalty by one (to a minimum of 0).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Home Ground Spend enough time somewhere, and you get to know it like the back of your hand. In the local neighborhood, you know every turn, every back alley, every shop on the block, the local rivalries and romances, and you can use all of it to your advantage. In the Matrix, you’ve spent count- less hours in the code, you know its gremlins, its quirks, the local avatars, and the ones that are out of place. • Cost: 10 Karma • Game Effect: Select a neighborhood or Ma- trix host each time you take this quality. Outdoors and Perception tests made in your Home Ground gain an Edge for use on that test; if you do not use the Edge on that test, it goes away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Human-Looking Small orks, tall dwarfs, and ugly elves do exist. Whether through genetics or modifications, you do not look like your birth metatype; you appear human. The points in your ears are easily over- looked, your tusks are filed down to mere teeth, your cheekbones are rounder, your legs longer&mdash; that sort of thing. You can pass for human, which might help with humans or cause obstacles with non-humans. • Cost: 8 Karma • Game Effect: You generally appear human at first glance and gain +2 dice on Disguise tests to hide your metatype and appear more human.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indomitable Whether through deep studies, natural selection, or intense training, your mind is hard to break. You can hold out longer under interrogation, shrug off mild injuries with ease, and hold your mind against the onslaught of incoming mana. • Cost: 12 Karma • Game Effect: Edge Boost costs are reduced by 1 on tests involving Willpower.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Juryrigger When you don’t have the time or the parts to do it right, you can still get it done. Whether it’s slapping on duct tape, twisting together wires that maybe shouldn’t be connected, or just giving the thing a swift kick, you find a creative way to get a machine working, even if only briefly. • Cost: 12 Karma • Game Effect: When performing a Juryrigging test (see p.&nbsp;95), you gain a point of Edge that must be spent on that test, or it goes away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Long Reach Whether it’s because of long arms, long legs, or some exceptional physical grace, you are able to reach people with melee weapons easier than others. • Cost: 12 Karma • Game Effect: When you are using a melee weapon, Close range is extended to 5 meters instead of 3.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Low-Light Vision Thanks to an increase in the number of rod cells in your natural eyes, an implanted increase of said rod cells, or an augmentation that enhances the light level of incoming data, you are capable of operating in light levels that would leave others essentially blind. • Cost: 6 Karma • Game Effect: You can see clearly in any light level that is not total darkness (see Environ- ment and Visibility, p.&nbsp;118).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic Resistance You could have been born under a blood moon, filled your body with foreign substances, or had bits of your soul sucked out by a spirit or vampire. For good or ill, mana just doesn’t seem to want to connect with you. Whether it’s a manabolt trying to melt your brain, a fireball trying to cook you alive, or a healing spell trying to mend your wounds, it’s just harder to get magic to work on you. • Cost: 8 Karma</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHARACTER CREATION // QUALITIES</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Game Effect: You gain a bonus Edge for use on any Magic Resistance test; if you do not use it on that test, that point goes away. When a Health spell is cast on you, treat your Essence as if it were 2 points lower than it actually is.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mentor Spirit You believe in something other than yourself to help guide and channel your magic, and that something believes in you. Whether it be the totem of Wolf, the Norse god Loki, or the Christian God, you utilize your beliefs to shape and focus your arcane abilities more easily. • Cost: 10 Karma • Game Effect: You gain the benefits listed with the description of your mentor spirit (see p.&nbsp;162). If you fail to keep aligned with one of those tenets, you lose your faith and connec- tion to your mentor and all associated bonuses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Photographic Memory Most people store life in clips, but you keep the recording running all the time. It’s a ton of infor- mation to deal with at times, but it has made you great for trivia night and remembering the favorite color of your childhood friend. • Cost: 12 Karma • Game Effect: You gain a bonus Edge point when making a Memory test (p.&nbsp;67). If you do not use this point of Edge on the test, it goes away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Quick Healer You tend to heal from injury quicker than your peers, which is incredibly valuable in a profession that is all about putting your body on the line. • Cost: 8 Karma • Game Effect: Cut the interval for any natu- ral healing test (p.&nbsp;120) in half, meaning you can heal Stun Damage after half an hour and Physical Damage after half a day.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Resistance to Pathogens When you claim, “I’ve never been sick a day in my life,” there’s a good chance it may be true. You have a very healthy immune system that has mas- tered the art of fighting off any and all comers that try to slip into your body and make you sick. • Cost: 12 Karma • Game Effect: You gain a bonus point of Edge when you make a Pathogen Resistance test. If you do not use it on that test, it goes away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit/Sprite Affinity (select classification) You have earned respect among a particular 73 group of spirits/sprites. Through actions and fa- vors, you’ve gained a positive reputation that makes them treat you with extra consideration. • Cost: 14 Karma • Game Effect: When selecting this quality, choose a type of spirit or sprite. You gain a bonus point of Edge when making a Con- juring or Tasking test for your chosen class of spirits/sprites. This quality can be taken multiple times, selecting a new class of spir- its/sprites each time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thermographic Vision Thanks to enhancements or just genetics, your vi- sion allows you to see differences in temperature on and around objects and people, though most of the time ambient regular light overrides the heat signature. Large local sources of heat can create a glare of sorts, but usually something giving off that much heat is also giving off light, so your regular vision takes over. • Cost: 8 Karma • Game Effect: You can see the heat of ob- jects in total darkness (assuming they are warmer or colder than the ambient tem- perature), allowing you to operate in such conditions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Toughness Whether it’s mental training, a physical regimen of self-inflicted injury, or you’re just one tough bastard, you can take a bit more of a beating and shrug off the injuries better than most. • Cost: 12 Karma • Game Effect: You gain a bonus point of Edge when making Damage Resistance tests. If you do not use it on the test, it goes away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Toxin Resistance Whether through naturally superior organs or because you think getting bit by a snake on a dai- ly basis is a fun way to pass the time, you’re able to better resist the effects of toxins in the Sixth World. • Cost: 12 Karma • Game Effect: You gain a bonus point of Edge when you make a Toxin Resistance test (p.&nbsp;121). If you do not use it on that test, it goes away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">QUALITIES // CHARACTER CREATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">Will to Live (1-3) No matter how hard the hit, you have the te- nacity to hold on to the bitter end. You are quite capable of taking a .50-cal round to the chest and waking up in the hospital, rather than never wak- ing up at all. • Cost: 8 Karma per level • Game Effect: For every rank of this quality you possess, you gain two additional Dam- age Overflow boxes (see p.&nbsp;121).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Negative Qualities Addiction (Substance, 1 to 6) Some habits just can’t be kicked. It might be as simple as a need for a drag off that nic-stick to cool your nerves, or as life-twisting as a need for something better-than-life, but whatever it is, it’s got a firm grip on you. • Bonus: 2 Karma per level • Game Effect: You cannot earn Edge or spend Edge in any form while suffering withdraw- al.&nbsp;Withdrawal times (the time that passes before you need your next hit) and require- ments are based on the level of addiction and can be found on the Addiction Withdrawal table. When in withdrawal, take a &ndash;2 dice- pool penalty on all tests; increase that pen- alty by 1 each time you pass another With- drawal time period.</p>
<p class="calibre1">addiction withdrawal table 1 1 week 2 3 days 3 1 day 4 12 hours 5 6 hours 6 1 hour</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHARACTER CREATION // QUALITIES</p>
<p class="calibre1">Allergy (Substance, Severity) Maybe it’s a runny nose and poorly timed sneezes from pollen, or a full-blown anaphylactic reaction from some of those rare natural peanuts. Whatever it is, you suffer some level of discomfort from a substance found in the Sixth World. • Bonus: 2 to 20 Karma. The highest bonus is for a common extreme allergy, with a Karma bonus of 20. The Allergy Table lists a bonus modifier for each other type of allergy. A se- vere allergy has a &ndash;3 modifier, while an un- common allergen has a &ndash;6. These two com- bine to &ndash;9; combining that with 20 makes the bonus from an uncommon severe allergy 11 • Game Effect: Select an allergen and severity to determine Karma value. You cannot spend</p>
<p class="calibre1">or earn Edge while exposed to your allergen. You also suffer secondary effects, which are listed below. • Mild: You experience a &ndash;2 dice pool modifi- er to any test involving a Physical attribute while the allergen is affecting you. • Moderate: You experience a &ndash;4 dice pool modifier to any test involving a Physical attri- bute while the allergen is affecting you. • Severe: You experience a &ndash;4 dice pool modifier to any test involving a Physical attribute while the allergen is affecting you. You also suffer 1 box of unresisted Physical Damage for every minute you are exposed to the allergen. • Extreme: You experience a &ndash;6 dice pool mod- ifier to all actions and suffer 1 box of unresist- ed Physical Damage for every 30 seconds you are exposed to the allergen.</p>
<p class="calibre1">ALLERGEN SEVERITY BONUS MODIFIER Common Extreme &mdash; Seasonal Severe &ndash;3 Uncommon Moderate &ndash;6 Rare Mild &ndash;9</p>
<p class="calibre1">AR Vertigo Whether it’s just too much information, a focal issue in your visual field, or just an inability to fo- cus when there’s so much to look at, you get dizzy and nauseated when utilizing AR. • Bonus: 10 Karma • Game Effect: You cannot gain or spend Edge while utilizing AR of any sort. You also gain the Nauseated status (p.&nbsp;52) while using AR and for one hour after you exit it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Astral Beacon Whenever people talk about someone having a “bright soul,” they make it sound like a good thing. You know it’s not. Your bright aura makes you stick out like a sore thumb on the astral. You have a hard time hiding or masking your aura, you can’t hide your feelings worth a damn, and attempts to locate you magically can be managed by first-year dropouts from Hagerstown Community College’s Arcane Studies program. • Bonus: 10 Karma</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Game Effect: You are considered Untrained for all Stealth tests in the astral plane. You can never take the masking metamagic. Assensing tests made against you get a free Edge, and all 75 thresholds are reduced by 1. Astral Tracking tests made against you gain 2 Edge, and all thresholds are reduced by half.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bad Luck You were born under a bad sign, broke a mir- ror, spilled some salt, got the evil eye laid on you, or just can’t catch a break. No matter the reason, things just go wrong around you. Often. • Bonus: 10 Karma • Game Effect: Glitches occur more frequently. Count dice showing both 1 and 2 for deter- mining a glitch. This does not affect critical glitches, only regular glitches.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bad Rep Word on the street does not speak favorably of you. Maybe you lost a team or got kicked from a team for breaking during interrogation. Whatever it is, your reputation precedes you, and never in the way you want it to. • Bonus: 8 Karma • Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge on Social tests. If you engage in a Teamwork test to assist a Social test, no one can spend Edge, and the opposing individual gains a point of Edge.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Combat Paralysis No matter how many times the street sam takes you to the range, you just can’t help but jump and freeze that first time they start shooting. Sure, you recover, but you always feel a half step behind in the fight. • Bonus: 8 Karma • Game Effect: Your Initiative Score is divided in half at the start of combat. You cannot take a Move or Sprint action in the first round, and you act last in that round. Your movement is restored to normal after the first round, but your Initiative Score is unchanged.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dependents (1 to 3) Children, lovers, or something other, you have people relying on you for financial support. They live in your doss, eat your food, use your trid ac- count, and generally cost you enough nuyen to keep you looking for that next score. • Bonus: 4 Karma per level • Game Effect: Choose a level for the depen- dents. Level 1 dependents are the equivalent of a family member who does not live with</p>
<p class="calibre1">QUALITIES // CHARACTER CREATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">you but still needs support. Five percent of any score goes to this person. Level 2 depen- dents are more stable costs, like the support 76 of a high-maintenance significant other, a child, or a small family. This level costs the runner 10 percent of every score. Level 3 de- pendents are rare in the shadows, because most runners don’t have a regular family and a second life outside the shadows, which is what this level entails. This level costs the runner 25 percent of all their scores. For purposes of this quality, a “score” is any in- come that comes their way. Job payments, fencing stolen goods or paydata, or even gambling winnings. The people important to you prosper when you do!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Distinctive Style You only fit in when you’re in places where no one fits in. The way you dress and look are unique to you. This isn’t just a pink mohawk or a sig- nature black trenchcoat. This is a two-meter-tall SURGEd lizard with a rainbow head frill, a head full of piercings including a bullring in his snout, dressed in full punk regalia. This is an albino ork who wears white sunglasses and a white trench coat over a head-to-toe white suit. A distinctive style is more than just what you choose to put on each day&mdash;it’s a way of life. • Bonus: 6 Karma • Game Effect: You cannot gain or spend Edge when you’re not rocking your distinctive look. Others get a +2 dice pool bonus when conduct- ing a Memory test (p.&nbsp;67) to recall your appear- ance or remember if they have seen you before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elf Poser Your blood may be human or ork, but your ears, cheekbones, and hoity-toity attitude are all elf. A surgery here and there, maybe a Sperethiel class on the Matrix, and a lot of time watching footage of the Tír princes has you all set to join those you feel you truly belong with, no matter how round your ears or broad your tusks were at birth. • Bonus: 6 Karma • Game Effect: Elves, orks, and trolls gain a point of Edge in Influence (Etiquette) tests made against you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Glass Jaw Doesn’t take much to lay you on your hoop. You just never could take a punch. • Bonus: 4 Karma per level • Game Effect: You have 1 less Stun Box for each level of this Quality, down to a mini- mum of 2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gremlins Commlinks freeze, guns jam, car tires blow, electrical systems short. Any and every thing that could go wrong with some fidgety bit of tech in your hands has gone wrong at one point in your life. • Bonus: 6 Karma • Game Effect: Whenever you use any device, roll 2D6. If you get a 1 on either die, it means the device fails to function correctly and can be treated as a glitch. The device can be quickly reset with a Minor Action and used again. Rolling snake eyes (double 1s) means the device fails catastrophically, and the roll can be treated like a critical glitch. The de- vice is done for good and you might be in for a bit of hurt from shock or biofeedback.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Honorbound You have a code. You live by the code. You die by the code. There are many codes, each with a set of tenets that must be obeyed to maintain the balance in your soul, heart, qi, brain chemistry, etc. • Bonus: 10 Karma • Game Effect: You cannot spend or earn Edge for twenty-four hours after you break a ten- et of your code. If the same tenet is broken multiple times or broken again during the twenty-four hour period, each infraction adds another forty-eight hours onto the ini- tial twenty-four. If a different tenet is bro- ken, it’s twenty-four hours for that one add- ed to any current infractions, and the same rules apply for additional violations. See the Honorbound sidebar for some sample codes and tenets.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Impaired (Attribute) Some folks are just not meant to be naturally talented. A bum knee, poor genetics, or an illness as a kid has you lacking the maximum achieve- ment level of your peers. • Bonus: 8 Karma per level • Game Effect: For each level, the character’s maximum for the chosen attribute decreases by 1, to a minimum of 2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Incompetent (Skill) No matter how much you practice and try to figure it out, there are some skills you just can’t manage to get right. • Bonus: 10 Karma • Game Effect: When this quality is chosen, se- lect a skill. You are unable to gain ranks in</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHARACTER CREATION // QUALITIES</p>
<p class="calibre1">honorbound The following are some codes that could be selected with the Honorbound quality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Assassin’s Creed A character with this code will kill for money, but only for money. They never resort to indiscriminate mayhem. Their code states that no innocent or unwary bystanders can be hurt by their actions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black Hat This is a tricky code and should only be chosen with ap- proval from the group you’ll be playing with, players and gam- emaster both. A Black Hat character believes in looking out for themselves first. If they do not see gain for themselves in an action, they won’t do it. Altruism is for suckers. That doesn’t mean that they’ll automatically abandon or turn on their fellow team members, because long-term loyalty can bring substan- tial rewards. But ethical qualms over whether a job is the right thing to do are completely foreign to them, and they won’t go out of their way to help innocent victims, because those words have no meaning. It seems like it should be an easy code to follow, but as with the other codes, sometimes emotions have a way of messing up people’s intentions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bushido Righteousness, courage, compassion, respect, honesty, honor, loyalty, and self-control are the key principles of the Bushido code. While there is room for some interpretation in the meaning of those words, the character cannot veer from their established definition of the words without penalty.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Code Duello The central belief here is that interpersonal conflicts of a certain level should be settled one on one, in a duel of honor. The character can set the level of dispute that requires a duel, but it should be sufficiently high so that the character is not challenging people to duels every few minutes, but sufficiently low that the character will have to issue a challenge at some point.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Khalsa A code followed by select Sikh warriors, Khalsa has four prohibitions: no cutting hair, no halal meat, no cohabitation with anyone besides a spouse, and no alcohol, tobacco, or drugs. The duties include honesty, fairness, loyalty, and resist- ing tyranny and persecution.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pirate Code Based on some of the ideals and concepts from eigh- teenth-century pirates, this changes from person to person, but these are some of the most common elements: Everyone on a team has an equal voice and receives an equal share; no stealing or dishonesty between team members; no abandon- ing the ship (i.e., stick with the team until the bitter end); and always be prepared.</p>
<p class="calibre1">White Hat This code is simple&mdash;people cannot die as a direct result of the character’s actions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">the selected skill. You cannot be Incompetent in skills you have no chance to perform&mdash; so you cannot choose this quality for Magic skills if you do not have a Magic rating, and you cannot choose it for Tasking if you do not have a Resonance rating. This skill may only be selected once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In Debt Sometimes to get cash you need to owe cash. You’ve built up a bit of debt trying to get a foot- hold in the shadows. • Bonus: None • Game Effect: When you spend Karma for cash, every point of Karma you spend gets you 5,000 instead of 2,000 nuyen. Each point of Karma spent also puts you 5,000 nuyen into debt with someone very danger- ous and capable of collecting. You must pay a monthly interest rate of 500 nuyen per Karma spent, in addition to any payment to the principal. If the interest is not paid, the lenders come searching for you. You must re- pay interest at a rate of 200 nuyen per level of this quality, which addresses interest only,</p>
<p class="calibre1">not principal. If the payment is not made, the lenders come searching for you. The quality can be bought off purely with money; if the principal is repaid the quality is eliminated. This quality can be obtained only during character creation, not during gameplay.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Insomnia Sleep? What’s that? It could be nightmares, brain damage, funky biochemistry, or a psycholog- ical disorder, but no matter the reason, you just can’t get a good night’s rest. • Bonus: 4 Karma • Game Effect: Without proper rest, you can’t regain Edge or spend it as you might like. Each day the runner must make a Body + Willpower (3) test to get a successful night of rest. If they fail, they cannot earn more than two Edge from any source that day. Also, they cannot spend more than 2 Edge on any given test. The purchase and use of a sleep regulator reduces the threshold on the test to 1. The runner can also purchase medication (50 nuyen/dose) that reduces the threshold to 2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">QUALITIES // CHARACTER CREATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loss of Confidence Imposter syndrome, a single traumatic failure, or just too many rejections or small failures in life have left you doubting yourself at every turn. • Bonus: 6 Karma • Game Effect: During any encounter, the run- ner must make a Willpower (2) test as a Mi- nor Action. Failure means they cannot earn or spend Edge for the entire encounter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Low Pain Tolerance You’ve got sensitive nerves or a generally sen- sitive nature. For whatever reason, you are more affected by injuries and discomfort. • Bonus: 10 Karma • Game Effect: All wound modifiers are doubled.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ork Poser Your blood may be human or elf, but your ears, jaw, tusks, and rough attitude are all ork. A sur- gery here and there, maybe an Or’zet class on the Matrix, and a lot of time watching documentaries on the Seattle Underground has you all set to join those you feel you truly belong with, no matter how round your ears or thin your frame was at birth. • Bonus: 6 Karma • Game Effect: Elves, orks, and trolls gain a point of Edge in Influence (Etiquette) tests made against you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prejudiced (Group) You have some deep-seated views and beliefs about a certain group, and no matter what anyone says, you know they’re no good. Your opinion of them is so negative and distracting you just can’t keep focused on other things while they’re around. • Bonus: 8 Karma • Game Effect: Select a specific group or type of people. You are unable to gain or use Edge while the object of your prejudice is present (unless you’re attacking them). • Note: Gamemasters and players should use this quality carefully. Everyone in the group should be on board with it being used, and it should never be used as a veiled excuse to state real-world prejudices or verbally attack, either directly or indirectly, other players.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scorched A Matrix, simsense, or BTL experience has fried your neurons to the point of perpetual fraz- zle, causing trouble when you’re logged on, even when it’s just AR.</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Bonus: 6 Karma • Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge while accessing the Matrix. This includes through use of commlinks, smartlinks, and any other source of data coming in from the ether.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sensitive System It could be latent unexpressed arcane talent or just a hyperactive immune system, but the result is the same. Your body does not like to have any- thing grafted or merged with it that isn’t part of its natural code. • Bonus: 8 Karma • Game Effect: Essence costs are dou- bled for all cyberware, bioware, and nanoware. Geneware suffers no ill effects. You cannot have this quality if you have a Magic or Resonance rating. (Note that nanoware and geneware will be covered in future books.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simsense Vertigo Somewhere inside your brain, you’ve got some wires crossed. Whenever you log onto the Matrix in VR, your disorientation is nauseating. • Bonus: 6 Karma • Game Effect: You cannot gain or spend Edge while accessing the Matrix via VR. You also receive the Nauseated status (p.&nbsp;52) for one hour after you log off the Matrix.</p>
<p class="calibre1">SINner Unlike a lot of runners, who have either no SIN or a criminal SIN, you have a legitimate SIN that links back to biometric data. You have enough attachment to it, whether for your own or family purposes, that you can’t just burn it. • Bonus: 8 Karma • Game Effect: You pay taxes to the issuer of your SIN, either a megacorporation or a nation. This cost comes as a 10 percent in- crease in the cost of the lifestyle associated with this SIN. Due to data within the Global SIN Regis- try, you are easier to track or identify, giving opponents a point of Edge every time they attempt a Trace Icon action against you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Social Stress There is a social situation that simply does not work for you, like being in large groups, talking to new people, being the center of atten- tion, being out of the spotlight, or a myriad of</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHARACTER CREATION // QUALITIES</p>
<p class="calibre1">other situations that some folks find totally nor- mal but you find ridiculously stressful. • Bonus: 8 Karma • Game Effect: Select a specific social stress- or. When encountering your social stressor, you must make a Charisma (2) test as a Mi- nor Action. Failure means you cannot earn or spend Edge until you succeed. You can choose not to take the test but if so, any tests made against you gain a bonus Edge.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit/Sprite Bane You may have angered them with how you treat their fellows, killed a powerful and respected member of their kind, or been born under a bad sign and marked as an enemy to entities like them. The reason doesn’t matter&mdash;what matters is the fact that a certain type of spirit/sprite has an inher- ent dislike for you. • Bonus: 12 Karma • Game Effect: When selecting this quali- ty, choose a type of spirit or sprite. Spirits/ sprites from that category gain a bonus point of Edge when you attempt a Conjuring or Tasking test against them. This quality can be taken multiple times, selecting a new class of spirits/sprites each time. In combat, spirits/sprites of the chosen type will attack you first and relentlessly, often to the point of savaging a dead body or bricking a deck if they have nothing else to do.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncouth At some point in life, the filter between your thoughts and your mouth disappeared. You con- sider yourself brutally honest, but others tend to see you as rude and abrasive. • Bonus: 6 Karma • Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge on any test using Charisma.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Uneducated Maybe book learning just wasn’t your thing, or maybe you were never exposed to vast quantities of information solely for the sake of expanding your knowledge base. Either way, you have a defi- nite lack in your basic education. • Bonus: 6 Karma • Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge on any test using Logic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unsteady Hands Nervous tics, excessive caffeine intake, or a gen- eral clumsiness might be the cause, but the results are all the same: You can’t draw a straight line to save your life. You also have a real hard time typ- ing, tying your shoes, and keeping a gunsight on the target. • Bonus: 4 Karma • Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge on any test using Agility that directly involves your hands (that is, a Stealth test to pull off sleight- of-hand would directly involve the hands, as would an Attack test with any weapon held in the hands, but an Athletics test involving running would not, even though the hands are in motion while running).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weak Immune System Perpetual sniffles are annoying to both you and your team, but a poorly timed sneeze or a sudden need for a bathroom can mean the end of a good run. You’re sick almost all the time. It may just be a minor cold, or it could be a nasty case of influ- enza or worse, but you’ve never met an infection you didn’t want to take home and hang out with for a bit. • Bonus: 8 Karma • Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge to re- sist the effects of an infection. The threshold for fighting off any infection you are exposed to is increased by 1. While suffering the ill ef- fects of an illness, you suffer a &ndash;1 dice pool modifier to all tests.</p>

To appease the needs of the street, the combat mage also knows the value of a combat medic for field patch-ups as well as the need for a little cover for an expeditious retreat.

The joy of pulling up a sprite and sending the little mischief-maker off to pester some fool who cut in front of you at the Stuffer Shack is a minor perk. All of this without the need to empty out your bank account or get half your head replaced with a deck and cyberjack.</p>

<p class="calibre1">SKILLS // SHOW YOUR TALENTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">SHOW YOUR TALENTS This chapter lists all the skills for Shadowrun, Sixth World and describes their usage. It is detailed but not exhaustive&mdash;we cannot anticipate the vast creativity of Shadowrun players, so there are likely to be actions they take that are not specifically listed here. These guidelines, though, should let you know the basic ways ac- tions break down into skills so you can devise the right test to see if shadowrunners pull off a glorious victory&mdash;or end up face-down in the gutter. Skill ranks range from 1 to 9. Each skill description lists some specializations associated with the skill. When you have a specializa- tion, you get a +2 dice pool bonus when rolling a skill test related to that area. Once a specialization is purchased, it can be turned into an expertise, meaning it gets a +3 bonus. If you have an expertise, you are allowed to select a second specialization attached to that skill. That specialization may not become an expertise, and no skill can ever have more than 1 expertise and 1 specialization attached to it. The listings of specializations with each skill are not exhaus- tive&mdash;if players develop a specialization within a skill that they would like to have, and their gamemaster approves it, they can have it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Skills also link to an attribute to form a dice pool, and the primary linked attribute is listed with the skill. If there are other attributes linked to the skill, they are listed as secondary attri- butes. The listing includes a note about whether the skill can be used untrained or not. Remember that attempting to use a skill untrained means rolling (linked attribute &ndash; 1).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Astral Specializations: Astral Combat, Astral Signa- tures, Emotional States, Spirit Types Untrained: No Primary Linked Attribute: Intuition Secondary Linked Attribute: Willpower, for as- tral combat. This skill can only be used by full or aspect- ed magicians, or by adepts and mystic adepts who have chosen the Astral Perception adept power. It has two primary uses&mdash;one is for assensing astral auras, as described on p.&nbsp;159. The other is for as- tral combat, as described on p.&nbsp;160.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Athletics Specialization: Archery, Climbing, Flying, Gym- nastics, Sprinting, Swimming, Throwing Untrained: Yes Primary Linked Attribute: Agility Secondary Linked Attribute: Strength (used for tests where extra resistance might be offered, like running through mud or something) The Athletics skill is about physical grace and prowess, which is a combination of a number of factors&mdash;strength, speed, quickness, nimbleness, and so on. More than that, it is the ability to coordinate all those qualities together, to draw on your abilities to meet what the situation de- mands. As a skill with a variety of uses, it can be em- ployed in different ways. It is used in Sprint tests (p.&nbsp;44) and Dodge Actions (p.&nbsp;43), and it is an attack skill for thrown weapons. In general, it is paired with Agility to express a certain fluidity of movement, but it also can be linked to Strength for tests when sheer muscle power is needed. These tests are often Simple tests (Full Defense being an exception). Diving and free-falling are covered with this skill. Beyond these guidelines, there are a few specific types of Athletics tests listed below.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Climbing Climbing tests are all about moving in a direc- tion where gravity is working against you and one slip might not only end your progress but cause significant harm. The Climbing test is Athletics +</p>
<p class="calibre1">CLIMBING THRESHOLDS Base threshold 3 93 Surface is slick +1 Surface is smooth +1 Surface is greased* +1 Surface has clear hand/footholds 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">*This includes any deliberate treatment to make the climbing surface difficult to negotiate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Strength; for each net hit, you move 1 meter up, down, or sideways (player choice). The trick is determining the threshold; consult the Climbing Threshold table for the information on how to de- termine the threshold. If a player is equipped with climbing gear (p.&nbsp;279), they get a point of Edge when start- ing their climb. They do not keep gaining Edge each turn of the climb. If they attempt to pile up Edge by starting a climb, then jumping off, then starting a “new climb” on the same surface, you are allowed to give them a stern talking to and point them to the Preventing Edge Abuse section (p.&nbsp;45).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Escaping Shadowrunners are frequently getting put in places where they’d rather not be, and the priority quickly becomes about getting out. Escaping these places is an Athletics + Agility test; sample thresh- olds for this test are in the Escape Thresholds table.</p>
<p class="calibre1">escape THRESHOLDS RESTRAINT THRESHOLD Rope, plastic cuffs 2 Metal cuffs 3 Straitjacket 4 Containment manacles 5 Reinforced material +1 SITUATION ADJUSTMENT Character is being watched +1 Character is being restrained by another character See Grapple (p.&nbsp;111)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Swimming The base swimming speed for characters is 3 meters per combat round with a Minor Action (gear and augmentations may increase this). By making a Swimming test, which is Athletics + Agil- ity (2), you add (net hits/2, rounded up) to the dis- tance in meters. The threshold can be increased for choppy or otherwise difficult waters. Swimming is tiring, and the threshold should increase by 1 every fifteen minutes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">SHOW YOUR TALENTS // SKILLS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Biotech Specialization: Biotechnology, Cybertechnolo- gy, First Aid, Medicine Untrained: No Primary Linked Attribute: Logic Secondary Linked Attribute: Intuition (this is rarely used&mdash;it is applied when characters try to do something that is not exactly by the books) This skill is for characters who know metahu- man biology. In the Sixth World, that also means knowing how different augmentations and gear interact with it. This skill is used in First Aid tests (p.&nbsp;119) and Healing tests (p.&nbsp;120), and it also can be used when analyzing and repairing cyberware, bioware, and other augmentations. Another use is installing cyberware, but not other kinds of ’ware. Biotech is typically a Simple test, where the char- acter rolls Biotech + Logic and gains knowledge about a device or accomplishes repairs based on net hits. Gamemasters should use the basic Threshold Guidelines (p.&nbsp;36) when determining thresholds for these tests. Installing cyberware requires an Extended test. The threshold is (Rating x 3); if the ’ware has no rat- ing levels, count the rating as 2. The interval is one hour, and a minimum of a Biotech shop is required.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Close Combat Specialization: Blades, Clubs, Unarmed Combat Untrained: Yes Linked Attribute: Agility Are you near someone? Are you trying to hurt them? Then use this skill! Whether you’re punch- ing, stabbing, clubbing, or whatever, roll Close Combat + Agility vs.&nbsp;Reaction + Intuition (Athlet- ics can be added for Dodge; see p.&nbsp;43) Full details on Combat are in the Combat chap- ter (p.&nbsp;104).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Con Specializations: Acting, Disguise, Imperson- ation, Performance Untrained: Yes Linked Attribute: Charisma The key aspect of this group is persuasion where you act as someone or something you’re not. May- be you’re acting like the long-lost heir to a portion of Dunkelzahn’s hoard, or maybe you’re pretending to be a down-on-their-luck business suit looking to make a big score to launch them back to the top. Whatever the case may be, Con is the skill you use to convince other people that you are something you are not. Tests involving Con are Opposed tests, and the target rolls Intuition + Willpower to resist the con. Usually this is a simple pass/fail test, looking at whether the character pulled off their con or not, but if they scored a high number of net hits, the game-</p>
<p class="calibre1">master can consider the con to be extra persuasive, making the mark an all-the-more-willing participant. See Social Test Edge (p.&nbsp;97) for more informa- tion about how to gain Edge on social tests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Conjuring Specialization: Banishing, Summoning Untrained: No Primary Attribute: Magic This skill allows you to summon, bind, and banish spirits. For details, see Conjuring, p.&nbsp;146.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cracking Specialization: Cybercombat, Electronic War- fare, Hacking Untrained: No Linked Attribute: Logic In the Matrix, there are two basic kinds of actions: legal and illegal. Cracking is what you use for the illegal ones. For details on the uses of Cracking, see Matrix, p.&nbsp;171.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Electronics Specialization: Computer, Hardware, Software Untrained: Yes</p>
<p class="calibre1">SKILLS // SHOW YOUR TALENTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Primary Linked Attribute: Logic Secondary Linked Attribute: Intuition, for kludge work This is the other side of Matrix work, the legal side. Whether you’re using your commlink, kludg- ing some software, fine-tuning your hardware, or whatever, Electronics is the skill for you. You can find more details about its use in the Matrix chap- ter, p.&nbsp;170.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enchanting Specialization: Alchemy, Artificing, Disenchant- ing Untrained: No Linked Attribute: Magic Enchanting is used to craft&mdash;and sometimes demolish&mdash;foci, fetishes, and other items imbued with magic. Details about this can be found in the Magic chapter’s Enchanting section, p.&nbsp;149.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Engineering Specialization: Aeronautics Mechanic, Armor- er, Automotive Mechanic, Demolitions, Gunnery, Industrial Mechanic, Lockpicking, Nautical Me- chanic Untrained: Yes Primary Linked Attribute: Logic Secondary Linked Attributes: Intuition, for ju- ryrigging; Agility, for lockpicking Engineering is about making things do the things you want them to do&mdash;making cars move, planes fly, boats float, and machines spin and roar so they can achieve whatever purpose they were built for. As the specializations show, this can cover a wide range of areas, but the skill essentially covers four basic activities: building, repairing, juryrigging, and vehicle gunnery. Building and repairing both follow the same basic process&mdash;roll an Engineering + Logic Extended test, with the threshold deter- mined by the complexity of the item being built/re- paired (see Build/Repair Threshold table) and the interval is based on the complexity of the effort (see Build/Repair Interval table). Juryrigging is a Simple test, meant to get some- thing to work in the short term with a quick adjust- ment or even a swift kick. Make an Engineering + Intuition test, using the Threshold Guidelines as a guide instead of the Build/Repair Threshold. If the test is successful, the device functions for (net hits) minutes. Once it stops functioning, another Juryrig- ging test may be attempted, but the threshold should be at least 1 higher than the previous test, and pos- sibly more depending on how much wear and tear the machine absorbed in its juryrigged state. Engineering is also used to pick mechanical locks and maglocks. It is combined with Agility for these tests, with a threshold based on the complex- ity of the lock.</p>
<p class="calibre1">build/repair THRESHOLDS 95</p>
<p class="calibre1">build/repair interval INTERVAL TIME Basic interval 1 hour</p>
<p class="calibre1">Damage is … Straightforward &mdash; Complicated x2 Extensive x4 Total x10 Note that all intervals assume needed parts and tools are available.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Exotic Weapons Specialization: See below Untrained: No Linked Attribute: Agility Some weapons are not like any other, and you need particular training to use them. This skill is for those weapons. You must select a specialization to use this skill, and you can only use this skill with weapons for which you have a specialization. Ex- pertises cannot be acquired for this skill. You can buy ranks in this skill, and those ranks can be used with all specializations you have. This skill is ex- empt from the rule that you can only have one spe- cialization per skill, and you cannot have expertise in this skill. This skill functions the same as other combat skills, meaning you roll Exotic Weapons + Agility vs.&nbsp;Reaction + Intuition; see the Combat chapter for more details.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Firearms Specialization: Automatics, Longarms, Pistols, Rifles, Shotguns Untrained: Yes Linked Attribute: Agility Do you want to shoot things? Use this skill. The basics are, roll Firearms + Agility vs.&nbsp;Reaction + Intuition. The details that stack on top of that are available in the Combat chapter (p.&nbsp;104).</p>
<p class="calibre1">SHOW YOUR TALENTS // SKILLS</p>
<p class="calibre1">96</p>
<p class="calibre1">Influence Specialization: Etiquette, Instruction, Intimida- tion, Leadership, Negotiation Untrained: Yes Primary Linked Attribute: Charisma. Secondary Linked Attribute: Logic, when mak- ing a clear argument. Mainly in Negotiation, could also be in some leadership situations. This is the other way of shaping the opinions of others, along with Con. It might be said that this is the more honest side, but that would be under- selling the integrity of con artists and overselling the honesty of business negotiators. The point is, whether you are trying to inspire your fellow run- ners, squeeze a few nuyen out of Mr.&nbsp;Johnson, or let someone know that intense physical pain awaits them if they cross you, Influence is the skill to use. The test usually is Influence + Charisma, but some- times it can be Influence + Logic when the character is relying on pure reason to get their point across. It is opposed by Willpower + Intuition when Charis- ma is used, Willpower + Logic when Logic is used. Influence is also used for Instruction tests, which can shorten the time it takes to learn new skills (see p.&nbsp;68). Instructors must have 4 or more ranks in the skill they want to teach. The instructor makes an Influence + Charisma test, which reduces the time to learn a skill by 1 day per net hit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">See Social Test Edge (p.&nbsp;97) for more informa- tion about how to gain Edge on social tests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Outdoors Specialization: Navigation, Survival, Tracking, by environment (Woods, Desert, Urban Areas, etc.) Untrained: Yes Linked Attribute: Intuition While staying indoors forever, watching trids and eating WhompSnappers, seems like a good enough life, sometimes you have to go outside. Outdoors is to help deal with those times. Whether you are following the tracks of someone or some- thing, scaring up food, or figuring out the quick- est way to your destination, Outdoors is the skill to use. Typically this is a Simple test, Outdoors + Intuition with a threshold set using the Threshold Guidelines on p.&nbsp;36. Efforts to disguise tracks may set the threshold for Tracking tests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perception Specialization: Visual, Aural, Tactile, by Envi- ronment (Woods, Desert, Urban, etc.) Untrained: Yes Primary Linked Attribute: Intuition Secondary Linked Attribute: Logic, for pattern recognition.</p>
<p class="calibre1">SKILLS // SHOW YOUR TALENTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Is someone sneaking through the smog up ahead? Is there a secret compartment in that exec- utive’s desk? Where’s the light switch? These are some of the questions that can be answered with a Perception test. When observing an environment, this is a Simple test, Perception + Intuition with a threshold determined by the gamemaster based on how difficult it is to find what the players are looking for (sample thresholds can be found in the Perception Thresholds table, p.&nbsp;98). Perception is also used to attempt to see those who do not wish to be seen, in which case the test is Perception + Intuition vs.&nbsp;Stealth + Agility (sometimes these tests are not rolled concurrently; see the Stealth section for more details). Sometimes Perception is about more than just taking in the details of your surroundings or trying to spot a hidden object. It may be about seeing how different things link to each other, or discerning a pattern in events or movements. In those cases, a gamemaster can have a player make a Perception + Logic test, with the threshold based on the com- plexity of the information they are trying to piece together.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Piloting Specializations: Ground Craft, Aircraft, Watercraft Untrained: Yes Linked Attribute: Reaction When you want a vehicle to move in a tricky way, this is the skill to use (riggers live or die by this skill). This is generally a Simple Test, Piloting + Reaction with a threshold based on the difficulty of the maneuver they are attempting. Sometimes a Piloting roll is about trying to avoid a tail, or tail someone else, or some other multi-vehicle action. In these cases, it’s Piloting + Reaction vs.&nbsp;Piloting + Reaction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sorcery Specializations: Counterspelling, Ritual Spell- casting, Spellcasting Untrained: No Linked Attribute: Magic. The uses of Sorcery are numerous&mdash;too nu- merous to cover here! Instead, look at the Magic chapter for information on Spells (p.&nbsp;130), Coun- terspelling (p.&nbsp;143), and other uses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stealth Specialization: Camouflage, Disguise, Palming, Sneaking Untrained: Yes Linked Attribute: Agility. Shadowrunning isn’t supposed to be obvious, as you should be able to guess by the name, so Stealth is a very valuable skill. Stealth covers all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">activities characters perform that they do not want others to notice&mdash;sneaking into a research facility, slipping a credstick out from under a Mafia don’s nose, blending into a crowd of Lone Star officers, 97 and so on. Typically, a Stealth + Agility test is made at the start of such an effort, with the net hits being used as a threshold for others to notice what the character is up to. Sometimes the attempt at stealth happens spontaneously, so it is a Stealth + Agility vs.&nbsp;Perception + Intuition Opposed test. In some circumstances, but not all, the size of a character may play a role in how stealthy they can be. If the gamemaster judges it to be appropriate, the Body of a character can be used as a threshold for their Stealth + Agility test, or the threshold can be increased based in their size.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tasking Specialization: Compiling, Decompiling, Regis- tering Untrained: No Linked Attribute: Resonance This is the skill technomancers use to do var- ious technomancer activities. More information about these activities can be found in the Techno- mancers section (p.&nbsp;187).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Social Test Edge Some of the best shadowrunners around are the best talkers, the ones who get the job done without a single bullet fired. That requires some quick and smooth talking, and like combat, the surrounding circumstances can play a large role in how well the attempt to influence or con someone will go. The circumstances of a social test may allow one side or the other to gain Edge. The mechan- ics for this are not as numerically based as they are for combat&mdash;gamemasters will have to use judgment about when Edge is awarded and when it is not. The question at the core of the decision is simple: Does one side have enough advantage over the other that they should be awarded Edge? The following list shows some of the ways one side might gain Edge over the other in a social situa- tion, broken down by type of situation (not includ- ing instruction, since that tends to not be an ad- versarial process). Generally speaking, Edge would be awarded once, either at the beginning of an encounter or when particular circumstances arise, not repeatedly throughout the encounter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowledge Skills Knowledge skills do not have ranks, because they are not used directly in skill tests. Instead, they are used to provide opportunities to gain knowledge connected to other tests. For example,</p>

<p class="calibre1">SKILLS // SOCIAL TEST EDGE</p>
<p class="calibre1">if a character has Security Systems knowledge and performs a Perception test to look over a corporate facility exterior, their test might give them a chance to see where cameras are located and when patrols go by. If they have the Seattle Gangs knowledge skill, a successful Perception test might help them know that the people walking up to them are mem- bers of the Halloweeners gang. The Seattle Streets Knowledge skill would help them when making Outdoors tests in the Seattle area. Players may also make Memory tests (p.&nbsp;67) to see if they can recall certain facts about areas where they have a Knowl- edge skill. By definition, Knowledge skills cannot be used untrained. Below is a list of some, but certainly not all, possible Knowledge skills. Players are free to make their own, with gamemaster approval. • Aerospace Technology • Arcana • [Area] Gangs • Automobile Models • Combat Biker • Corporate Personalities • Espionage Techniques • Hacker Groups • Law Enforcement Corps • Magical Societies • Magical Traditions • Metaplanes • [Nation] Politics • Ork Cuisine • Orkxploitation Music • [Region/Era] History • Security Systems • Sixth World History • Spirit Types • [Sprawl] Streets • Tech Companies • Trideo Series • Troll Thrash Rock • Urban Brawl • Virtual Nightclubs • Weapons Manufacturers</p>
<p class="calibre1">Language Skills The Sixth World is full of a variety of languages. All the languages present in our world remain in place, as well as some new ones, such as Sperethiel, the language of the elves; Or’zet, the language of orks; and Cityspeak, the language of the streets.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowing how to speak these languages can be the key to picking up information people are trying to hide from you, or to building connections with important contacts. 99 Language skills are Knowledge skills with spe- cialization ranks. That means they have four levels, like so: • Sperethiel • Sperethiel (Specialist) • Sperethiel (Expert) • Sperethiel (Native) At the first level, you gain the ability to use Perception tests to understand things in that lan- guage, which you could not have done before. This functions the same as other Knowledge skills. At the second level, you gain 2 dice on tests related to understanding the language. At the third level, the dice pool bonus on tests to understand the lan- guage increases to 3. Native speakers do not have to roll a test to understand that language. Character advancement only allows you to ad- vance to Expert level. The only way to gain a Na- tive language is as part of the character creation process&mdash;one such language is selected for free during character creation, while qualities might provide a bonus language. You never need to make tests to understand things in your native language. The thresholds of tests to understand languages is based on the Threshold Guidelines table, p.&nbsp;36. Elements such as the volume and speed people use when speaking or the amount of slang/lingo em- ployed can affect the threshold. The skill works like this in practice: Cass Wan- dering Horse has picked up a little Sperethiel to help him in his investigative work, but not enough to be a specialist yet. While looking into a drug-smuggling ring, he overhears a couple mem- bers of the Ancients talking to each other in Spere- thiel. He leans in closer to see what he can make out. They are speaking quietly, so the gamemaster sets the threshold at 4. Wandering Horse has Per- ception 4 and Intuition 5, so he rolls 9 dice to see if he can make out what they are saying. His team- mates, who do not have the Sperethiel language skill, have no chance to understand what is being said, so they have to rely on Wandering Horse. If he were a specialist, he could increase his dice pool for the test to 11; expertise would make it 12. He rolls 5 hits, just enough to make out that the words “bar,” “Puyallup,” and “novacoke” are part of the conversation. He has a lead to follow!</p>

<p class="calibre1">The Way Up by Kevin Czarnecki</p>
<p class="calibre1">The eighty-sixth floor. At last. Hiroki stepped out from the lift to a view of Neo-To- kyo he had only dreamed of. Up here, a Shiawase exec- utive saw the megasprawl like a carpet of jewels spread out before them, a limitless territory ripe for develop- ment. He imagined the city divided up in AR, the ebb and flow of populations, markets, profits waiting to be made, and careers with them. The secretary didn’t spare him a glance, speaking in flawless Afrikaans through a headset while he fidgeted. His own modest office, thirty stories below, was nothing like this. He had stepped into the world of gods and was only a mere mortal. He imagined her income&mdash;his own salary, with an extra zero&mdash;as he took in her Vector cybe- reyes and Vasocon tetrachrome nails. How much body- sculpting went into that cold, angelic visage? Were those real diamonds in her lapel? “Hiroki-san! My friend!” He jumped and quickly composed himself, his heart failing to calm as his sweaty palm met Sato’s in a shake. The superior executive’s skin was silky, moisturized, confident, and sure. Dry. Sato flashed his million-nuyen smile and clapped the other hand on Hiroki’s shoulder, guiding him further into the executive opulence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“S-Sato-sama, I&mdash;” “I’m so glad you’re here. And so punctual! That’s what we’re looking for, Hiroki. Someone with attention to detail.” “Sir?” They had shifted past the frosted glass of a meeting room to an office paneled in real oak, stained rich and fragrant from cigars and sake. Sato gestured for Hiro- ki to take a seat in one of the overstuffed, real-leather chairs while he leaned on the massive desk’s corner with the poise of a practiced Berwick model. “Hiroki, you’re being promoted.” The junior executive’s heart raced, but he did his best to remain calm. Ignoring the perspiration gathering at his collar, he quirked his brows and struggled to main- tain a detached air. “Excellent, sir.” “I should say so!” Sato laughed, standing to walk over to a sideboard and pour two fingers of Suntori ’03 into a pair of crystal glasses. He handed one to Hiroki as he resumed his perch. “You’ve been with the company for a decade now, and your record is exemplary.” His gaze flashed with the twinkle of AR overlays. Hiroki wondered at his entire life flashing in another man’s eyes. “You’re being transferred to the Marketing Forecast- ing and Information Department.” Now Hiroki’s heart stopped. “The … the deniable assets?” Sato laughed. “Now, now, Hiroki, what a positively pop culture way of putting it. We prefer to think of them</p>
<p class="calibre1">SIXTH WORLD // THE WAY UP</p>
<p class="calibre1">as temporary outside hires. Freelance consultants.” He set his drink aside and rested his elbows on his knees, fingers laced together, a perfect oniisan. “Consider for a moment the independent analysts we bring in. They have access to data and trends even our own experts can’t factor into projections. We aren’t de- nying that we hire them, per se. It’s simply understood. And anyway, our competitors are certainly doing the same thing. Shiawase has every right to remain competi- tive, and that means playing the game.” “I, ah … I hadn’t thought about it that way, sir.” “Of course not! This is a whole new world for you.” Sato drew two fingers through the air, and an AR doc- ument became visible to Hiroki. “I think you’ll find the duties far more stimulating than Human Resourc- es. And, of course, there is the significant remuneration package …” Hiroki’s eyes danced back and forth on the e-doc be- fore reaching a salary two zeroes greater than his current salary. Sato smiled knowingly at his sipped the Suntori.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s all simple.” He repeated Sato’s words, a slow mantra and he flipped through the MFID virtual rolo- dex. Faces, statistics, observations. The eyes of killers and maniacs, traitors and anti-corporate terrorists he was expected to pick and choose from to get a job done right. They were the types of people he’d invested nuy- en into avoiding. He’d rarely left the safety and surety</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Shiawase territory; there was no call for it. His every conceivable need or desire was right here, and more af- fordable with the corpscrip options he took in lieu of universally recognized nuyen. He took a deep breath and stood up from his desk, rolled his shoulders and signaled the clock in the corner of his vision. At 2 a.m., he was working overtime, even with the sleep regulator his promotion bonus had finally paid off. He turned to take in the new office. Not quite as big as Sato’s, of course, and somewhat sterile. It lacked the touches of habitation and experience. He imagined the holopics and trophies, keepsakes and touchstones of a career in its prime. For now, there was only the focus and the hardcopy poster he had brought from his old office, a silhouette of a man set against a broad orange sun, hiking up a steep incline, with the words below: “The Struggle Proves Elevation.” He turned to the win- dow and took in the view from the seventy-seventh floor, imagining his father the day he had given him the poster for his eighth birthday, imagining his approval now if he had lived to see this vista. “If only you could see how high I have climbed, Otousan.” His eyes returned to the display before his desk, and he softly muttered, “And how much higher still I shall come.” He was establishing patterns. Sato’s advice had been sparse, and his first assignment had come so quickly he did not have time to meet any of the other “Tana- ka-sans,” the men who shared his vocation and used the</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE WAY UP // SIXTH WORLD</p>
<p class="calibre1">102</p>
<p class="calibre1">pseudonym to maintain their anonymity. He wondered at that: Any so-called shadowrunner worth the pay should be able to discover a corporate-registered identity in short order, yes? But that had given him inspiration. The files were as thorough as they could be. True, the ideal assets were SINless, but no one could entirely avoid leaving a trail in this age of ubiquitous monitoring. But that provided him with the litmus he needed. The obvi- ous choices were those who had worked for Shiawase before. Previous operations were largely redacted, even with his new clearances, but the general nature of the job, the expectations, and how they were met were doc- umented by previous Tanakas, often with an informal grading system. Some even permitted themselves a flour- ish of creative liberty in their observations of the assets. There was hidden value there, as well. But it was too obvious for what Sato expected of him. “Your first priority is to reduce the bottom line, Hiro- ki,” he had said. “Results must come first and foremost, but we require lower investment points. This is your ob- jective. And to incentivize it, while we have a pay range for any given operation, the more you are able to shave from your budget, the more you will be rewarded with a bonus for your hard work.” Hiroki was less motivated by money than advance- ment, and that meant he needed success. Money would take care of itself in due course. His job was to refine the system. So what was he looking for that no other Tana- ka, or at least a successful Tanaka, would see? That was the key. A shadowrunner must go unseen. There was a balance of success and surveillance, com- pleted ops and a lack of documentation. The less known, the more potential. It was a gamble, but one he felt con- fident would pay off. He swept his hand across the desk, discarding the profiles that had mugshots. No good. He also filtered out any long-term assets. Reliable, yes, but they had worked with other Tanakas, and his experience said he need- ed his own small family of mercenaries with whom he could build his own relationship. Moreover, less experi- ence meant he could better dictate the terms of payment. He cross-referenced the stables of fixers, which Sato had kindly “loaned” him. He would be expected to make his own connections in time, but these would get him start- ed.&nbsp;He had basic profiles of skill sets, aptitudes, small notes and even warnings politely proffered by the fixer to make meeting them easier. He compared them to the objective at hand. Narrowed. Focused. Selected. His hand shaking, he took a deep breath. Dialed the fixer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hiroshi fidgeted as he waited in the corner booth of the Sakura. He was denied the view of Tokyo Disney’s faux New York skyline, but there were fewer cameras here, and he had a straight view from the bar. He did his best to ignore the pair of security personnel Sato had as- signed him, leaning nonchalantly and sipping their sodas as though they weren’t made of cutting-edge cyber and bioware and were masters of hand-to-hand combat. Two tourists approached the host, and, glancing around the room, they spotted him and waved, making their way over. The lead, a woman he guessed was of Eu- ropean descent, wore a turquoise sundress and sandals. She called to him. “Tanaka-kun!” Her partner, a short Japanese man, followed, his glaring LiveThread bowling shirt as bold as he was quiet. She outstretched her hands, grasping repeatedly so</p>
<p class="calibre1">that her long nails, matching her dress, clacked loudly. She squealed in delight, leaning over Hiroki to embrace him as he sat. She whispered in his ear, “Just play along. Helps us hide in plain sight.” The man, who might be the one the fixer called Su- zumebachi, slid in first, stiff, a short, bristly mustache and bulging muscles decorating an otherwise utterly ge- neric face. He didn’t look like a rigger; he looked pedes- trian, like a janitor. The woman must have been wearing a disguise, as she didn’t look like the distorted security footage he had seen. That figure had a mohawk and nu- merous piercings. This one had long brunette hair and an excellent tan, the lines from time spent on a sundeck in a bikini showing boldly. Was this Draht? “Very public place for a meet, Tanaka-san. Clever, but we didn’t have much time to compensate.” He had practiced his responses. They would try to test him, throw him off. He had to see them purely as employees. This was no different from any accountant or data processor across the desk. He did have whiskey this time, and they were trained killers, and they were in a Disney funpark, but otherwise it was the same. “Our mutual fri&mdash;” He cut himself short as the waiter came for the order. “My tab,” he said. She ordered fresh orange juice. The man went for the much less expensive Yamazaki twelve-year. “Your handler says you are capable of a data ex- traction?” She nodded&mdash;too enthusiastically&mdash;reaching across the table to touch his hand gently. The tone didn’t match at all, cool and professional. “Absolutely.” “Depending on the remuneration,” Suzembachi in- toned, his voice as bland as his expression. “And the commensurate risk.” “Yes.” He reached into his suit jacket pocket, a Rhine- Gold subtly disguising his origins with Evo cufflinks. He slid a chip across the table. Draht watched with amuse- ment. She and her partner touched their fingers to the chip, the details on closed loop to their PAN. He watched their eyes scan the document he could not see; he called up his own copy for his contacts. “The data is on a remote server, so you’ll need to re- trieve the physical storage drive. Moreover, we require the job to be done within forty-eight hours.” “Not at this price,” she responded politely. “Why not?” She smirked, and Suzembachi muttered, “Decreased time frame increases risk. Increased risk increases pay.” “Those are competitive rates.” “Are you telling us to see if the competition can do better?” He flustered, and Suzembachi’s meaty fist closed sightly. The waiter returned with their drinks. She leaned forward. “You’re new at this, aren’t you, Tanaka-san?” “What?” “You don’t need your guards. We’re not going to hurt you.” Hiroki tried to appear cool. “Guards?” She laughed. “Why do you think I hugged you? Your boys tensed up, and our guy spotted them.” Hiroki saw their waiter across the room shoot him a small wink. Was that Kage? “And you don’t seem to know the steps to this dance quite yet, though you’re doing an okay job.” Suzembachi made to rise. “Let’s go, D.” She stopped him. “No, no, our Tanaka-san here is do- ing his best, and we’re all professionals here. He wants to make a good impression, and I don’t think he’s out to screw us over. So let’s give him a chance.” She turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">SIXTH WORLD // THE WAY UP</p>
<p class="calibre1">back to Hiroki. “How about this? We’ll take it at the indicated rate, half up front, as a show of good faith. We do the job, you make your bosses happy, and when you’ve moved up the food chain a little bit, you can offer us juicier work. Maybe slip in a few bonuses.” He shouldn’t have let any emotion slip out, but the tension washed out of him. She was a dream, nothing at all like he had feared. He could get to like working with someone with this mindset. ”Excellent. You can contact me at the attached number, and we’ll arrange for your payment.” Everything was going better than he could have thought.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifty hours later, staring down the barrels of Shiawase security forces assault rifles, Hiroki wondered where he had gone wrong. “I&mdash;I really don’t&mdash;” “It’s fine, Hiroki. Really.” Sato’s charm was as present as ever as he adjusted his cuffs, standing over Hiroki in what had once been his new office. The desk had been removed, along with the plant. Only the poster remained. “We all get greedy, sometimes. You, though … so ear- ly into your promotion. I knew you were ambitious, but really, colluding with Mitsuhama?” “But I never&mdash;” “You were sloppy, Hiroki. That’s what disappoints me the most. I could at least admire disloyalty if the trai- tor was a clever opponent, but you just …” He tutted, looking again at the EMP gun in his hands he had fired at Hiroki, presumably to deactivate his commlink or any other gadgets he might have concealed. Hiroki stifled tears, his voice rising. “I would never betray&mdash;” The guards raised their rifles to take better aim. Hi- roki shrank back in his seat, and Sato smiled. “You’re my failure, you know. I should have looked closer. This will look very bad for me, Hiroki. I’m just some… dis- appointed.” He felt the will drain from him, sank into the leather. What were they&mdash; Sato’s eyes rose, narrowing behind Hiroki before he raised his HERF and shouted, “Open fire!” Hiroki had only a moment to glance over his shoul- der before the bullets began flying. Time seemed to slow, and he took in the details as though it were simsense: the municipal police drone hovering just outside the win- dow, the glass shattering from sustained fire from both it and the guards, Sato blasting at it, the sparks flying from it as it absorbed the assault. A shape spearing from across the street, a woman with a mohawk sliding into the room on the zipline it carried, firing as she went. The rounds slammed the guards, another drone coming from above the broken view of the neighboring building. Draht turning to him after Sato had fallen, his impecca- ble suit soiled by the blue of the gel rounds. She reached out to him, he scrambled for the poster, and the world spun and went dark.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was lying down, rough fabric under him. The room was spare, concrete and lit with spools of lumicord along the walls and detritus of the space, casting strange shadows in the strange world. Kage, now in a tank and fatigue pants, called through the door to his companions. “He’s up.” Hiroki sat up, his head spinning, as Draht walked in. She was the picture of Neo-Tokyo punk, her fishnets padding bare on the concrete. She wore a sad smile and rushed forward to pull a bucket from the bedside for him as he vomited the last meal he’d had as a Shiawase employee. Kage laughed while Suzembachi leaned against the doorframe. “He’s worthless. This was a mistake.” Draht glared at him as she patted Hiroshi’s back. “It’s okay, Tanaka-san. Your first firefight, right? It’s only nat- ural. I did the same thing. It’s fine. Adrenaline and shock. You’ll be fine.” She whispered to him until the world stopped spinning. When he sat back on the cot, Kage tossed him an electrolyte pouch. He nodded gratefully as he uncapped it and swigged its contents. “How … why …” “How did we know you were set up?” Hiroshi nodded. “You’re new. You tried really hard to hide where you were from.” Suzembachi joined in, listing items on his fingers. “Saeder-Krupp? No way. Evo cufflinks? Nope. And Disney? Renraku’s interests aren’t with Mitsuha- ma, they’re busy keeping Sony from expanding into their hosting contracts.” Kage grinned at him. “Or maybe it’s because the data we took was about Sato?” Suzembachi glared back. “Sato?” Draht pulled up a chair, crossing her arms over it’s back. “Sato was selling information to Mitsuhama. That drive wasn’t just their shadowrunner asset index, it was their corporate leaks. Sato wanted to clean up his trail, but he needed someone to pin it on.” “Gotta say, it’s refreshing to watch the Tanakas stab each other in the back instead of us for a change.” Draht waved off Kage, who shrugged and gave Suzembachi a playful kiss on the forehead as he left. The short man blushed slightly but kept his stony gaze at Hiroki. “He … he used me …” “Yeah.” “I have to report this to&mdash;” “No point.” Hiroki looked to Suzembachi. “What?” “You’re a Tanaka. Probably erased your SIN. Better hope that’s the case. Otherwise, it’s criminal now.” Draht reached on the desk behind her and offered a crumpled piece of paper. Hiroki opened it to find his father’s poster. “How about a little payback, Tanaka-san?” “Hiroki.” He looked up from the poster. “My name is Hiroki.” The struggle uphill had only just begun.</p>

<p class="calibre1">As the old saying goes, “Watch your back. Shoot straight. Conserve ammo. And never, ever, cut a deal with a dragon.” If you even want a chance to break that last tenet, you’re going to learn how to do the first three, and this chapter has a keg of knowledge to pour into your brain. It also covers punching, tossing knives, and the ever-exciting and utterly bomb-tastic grenades!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Combat process Let’s cover the basics real fast and first thing. We describe Combat processes&mdash;known as Attack tests going forward&mdash;in five easy steps. See the Step by Step sidebar for the quick and dirty overview of the pro- cess, and see below for a little more detail on each step.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 1: Grab Dice Since there’s always two sides to a fight, the attacker and defender both have things to do. If</p>
<p class="calibre1">step by step 1. Grab dice 2. Distribute Edge 3. Roll dice and Spend Edge 4. Soak some damage 5. Bring the pain</p>
<p class="calibre1">the attacker is a sneaky dirtbag and the defend- er is unaware when the attack starts, don’t worry about it&mdash;they still get limited participation. Being unaware of an incoming attack means a penalty to their Defense test. Maybe get a better Perception skill soon, before you’re dead and stuff. The attacker collects a number of dice equal to their [appropriate weapon skill] + Agility. By “appropriate weapon skill” we mean the skill best suited for the attack they described, be it a punch, kick, knife, sword, axe, broken bottle, lead pipe, candlestick (Close Combat); or a pistol, rifle, shot- gun, sniper rifle, zip gun (Firearms); or a blow-</p>
<p class="calibre1">COMBAT // COMBAT PROCESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">gun, laser pistol, ray gun, assault cannon, grenade launcher, or missile launcher (Exotic Weapon); or a thrown knife, shuriken, or hand grenade (Athlet- ics); or a vehicle-mounted weapon (Engineering). Though that last one goes with Logic, not Agility (the better to calculate all the angles and geometry that comes from firing from a vehicle). The defender collects dice equal to their Reac- tion + Intuition and modifies for Surprise, damage, and so forth. Once this is all said and done, you should have a pool of dice for each side.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 2: Distribute Edge This one is a little more complex. We have a few stats to compare, a quick look at the situation, and some character qualities and gear considerations to see what kind of Edge is available. First, compare the Attack Rating of the weapon to the Defense Rating of the target. If either is 4 or more greater than the other, the player with the bigger val- ue gets an Edge. For example, with Attack Rating 8 vs.&nbsp;Defense Rating 4, the attacker gets 1 Edge. Second, look at the situation. Is it raining, windy, dark, foggy, excessively bright, overcrowd- ed, etc.? Now, does either combatant have visual enhancements or gear to compensate? Compare and toss an Edge to whoever has the advantage. If it balances out, no one gets an Edge. See the section on Environment and Visibility (p.&nbsp;118) for more guidelines on this area. Then you’ll want to see if any gear or qual- ities come into play that might influence Edge distribution. Usually players will know their characters well enough to know when Edge pos- sibilities come up. If they don’t know yet, help them learn! Remember that you cannot gain more than two Edge in a single round, but you can save Edge across multiple combat rounds to build up a maxi- mum of 7 Edge points for that big play! Once Edge is set, move on to dice rolling!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 3: Roll Dice and Spend Edge Both sides get to decide whether they are going to use any Edge and for what purpose. There are sev- eral Edge Actions that are chosen up front, and sev- eral uses of Edge that can come in on the back end, but Edge can only be spent once per Action, so use it wisely. Uses of Edge are located in the Edge in Com- bat sidebar. If you’re using a pre-Edge option, declare it now so it can go into effect with the dice roll. Now, roll those dice pools! Count each 5 and 6 as a hit and keep track of each 1 (and 2 if your opponent is devious) to determine glitches. Com- pare the number of hits between the attacker and</p>
<p class="calibre1">defender to see if it is a hit or a miss. Ties go to the attacker. For glitches, count up each 1 (and 2 if Edge was spent to make those count). If the total is more than half of the dice pool, it’s a glitch. If you get a glitch and you didn’t get any hits (5s or 6s), you’ve gotten yourself a critical glitch! Way to go! You’ve just made your gamemaster’s day. More information on glitches can be found on p.&nbsp;44. But wait! Leave those dice there, because Edge is about to rear its beautiful head again. If some- one saved their Edge spending for the back end, now’s the time to use it. Once all the hits are tallied, call the attack a success or miss based on whether the attacker got more hits than the defender or vice versa. If it’s a success, add the net hits (meaning attacker hits mi- nus defender hits) to the base Damage Value of the weapon in use and move on to the next step. If the attacker and defender got the same number of hits, the attack simply does its base damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">EDGE IN COMBAT 1 Edge • Reroll one die (Post) • Add 3 to your Initiative Score (Any) • Use an Edge Action (Pre)</p>
<p class="calibre1">2 Edge • Add 1 to a single die roll (Any) • Give ally 1 Edge (Any) • Negate 1 Edge of a foe (Pre) • Use an Edge Action (Pre)</p>
<p class="calibre1">3 Edge • Buy one automatic hit (Any) • Heal one box of Stun damage (Any)</p>
<p class="calibre1">4 Edge • Add your Edge Attribute as a dice pool bonus to your roll, and make 6s explode (Pre) • Heal 1 box of Physical damage (Any) • Reroll failed dice (post) • Use an Edge Action (Pre)</p>
<p class="calibre1">5 Edge • 2s count for glitches for target (Pre) • Create special effect (Any) • Use an Edge Action (Pre)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 4: Soak Some Damage First off, if it was a miss, you’re done. Stop fol- lowing these steps and move on. If the attacker tagged the defender, bring that weapon Damage Value you modified in the last step down here. Now, the defender rolls their Body attribute. Each 5 and 6 cancels a point off that modified</p>
<p class="calibre1">105</p>
<p class="calibre1">COMBAT PROCESS // COMBAT</p>
<p class="calibre1">106</p>
<p class="calibre1">Damage Value. If they haven’t used their Edge yet, this might be a chance to lessen the incom- ing damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 5: Bring the Pain Apply the damage left after Step 4 to the appro- priate Condition Monitor (see Condition Moni- tors, p.&nbsp;38). You’ll also apply any secondary effects from the weapon at this point. The weapon has to do at least 1 box of damage for any secondary effects to take effect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">COMBAT examples There are many ways to hurt people in Shadowrun, and we wanted to provide examples of the step-by-step process for lots of them. In this chapter, you’ll find ex- amples for using Firearms (below), Melee Combat (w/ Grunts) (p.&nbsp;109), Grenades (p.&nbsp;115), Grenade Launchers (p.&nbsp;116), Gas Grenades (p.&nbsp;117), Exotic Weapons and Spray (p.&nbsp;118), and Healing (p.&nbsp;120).</p>
<p class="calibre1">FIREARMS example Oda, an honorable street samurai, is having a rough day with a group of Eye-Fivers who have decided numbers mean more than skill. He’s got his trusty Predator VI in hand and decides it’s time to cut the head off the snake and take out the one who looks like the leader. Let’s run through the steps!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step One: Grab Some Dice Oda is firing a pistol using Firearms 5 + Agility 7 + 1 for a wireless active smartlink (he’s not worried about a hacker in this gang), for a dice pool of 13. The Eye-Fiver defends with Reaction 4 + Intuition 3, a dice pool of 7.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Two: Distribute Edge Here we compare the Attack Rating of the Ares Preda- tor VI (8) to the Defense Rating of the Eye-Fiver (4; Body 3, + 1 for leathers) and see that Oda has a difference of 4 or more greater, giving Oda one bonus Edge. Next, we check out the situation. It’s nighttime in a dimly lit alley because Oda wanted to get them all bunched together and take advantage of the low-light vision on his cybereyes, which the gangers don’t have. This gives a sec- ond bonus Edge to Oda. Finally, we look at any other elements that might help either side. None are present, so the process moves on!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Three: Roll Dice and Spend Edge Oda decides to use those two bonus Edge right away, hop- ing to end this fight quick. He uses the 2 bonus Edge and 2 of his own to activate the 4-edge boost: Add Edge to your dice</p>
<p class="calibre1">Initiative We covered how to inflict the violence, so now let’s cover who gets to go first. At the start of Com- bat, each participant rolls their Initiative Dice and adds the total (that means adding up the numbers rolled, not just counting 5s and 6s) to their Ini- tiative Rating to see who goes first. The highest number goes first, followed by the next highest and so on down the line until you get to the low- est Initiative Score. Once you hit the bottom, the combat round ends, and you start a new one by jumping back up to the top of the order. If there is a tie in Initiative Score, break it by comparing specific attributes of the characters with the same score. The attributes to compare, in order, are ab- breviated ERIC (Edge, Reaction, Intuition, coin flip). If at any point in comparing these attributes you find that one character has a higher attribute than the other, the tie is broken, and that character goes first. The coin flip at the end will break the tie, should it somehow last that long.</p>
<p class="calibre1">pool, adding 5 more dice for a total pool of 18. He gets a whop- ping 9 hits with those exploding 6s from the Edge boost. The Eye-Fiver leader isn’t ready to go down without a fight. He spends his 1 bonus Edge and one of his Minor Ac- tions to do a Tactical Roll Edge Action (p.&nbsp;48), giving him the advantages of the Prone status against this attack, which is a +2 dice pool bonus for his Defense Test. This makes his fi- nal Defense Test dice pool 9 (Reaction + Intuition + 2), with which he rolls a solid 4 hits. Oda gets 5 net hits (9 hits &ndash; 4 hits) and moves them over to the next step!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Four: Soak Some Damage We calculate the incoming damage using the base Dam- age Value of the Ares Predator VI (3P) and add the net hits (5) to get a modified Damage Value of 8. The Eye-Fiver leader rolls Body 3 to soak the Damage and gets 1 hit, reducing the incoming damage to 7 boxes of Physical Damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Five: Bring the Pain Here we apply the damage to the Eye-Fiver leader’s Condition Monitor of 10 Boxes, leaving him with only 3 boxes. If the attack had any kind of secondary effects they would be applied here as well, but this one did not. This is also the point at which you compare the enemy’s injury level to their Professional Rating and determine if they are still in the fight. The Eye-Fiver leader has a Professional Rating of 3 and 7 boxes of damage, meaning it’s time to ei- ther sit on the ground and bleed or stumble away, because he’s done with this fight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">COMBAT // INITIATIVE</p>
<p class="calibre1">107</p>
<p class="calibre1">Initiative is not rerolled between combat rounds. The order from the previous round stands, with the exception of any Initiative Score adjustments that have occurred due to injury, special effects, etc.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Combat Round A combat round is approximately 3 sec- onds long in the game world. During a single combat round, each participant gets an al- lotment of Actions to use on or around their player turn. The basic Action allotment for each character is 1 Minor Action and 1 Ma- jor Action per combat round. Players get 1 additional Minor Action for every Initiative Die they have. Actions can be traded between Minor and Major, but there are restrictions. A Ma- jor Action can be used to perform a Minor Action, simple as that. A character can also trade 4 Minor Actions to perform 1 Major Action. Characters may never start a player turn with more than 5 Minor Actions. If they would have earned more through any cir- cumstances, that number is reduced to 5. The various Actions are described on page 40.</p>
<p class="calibre1">INITIATIVE EXAMPLE On another bad day, Carson Aims and Oda are having a drink to sort out their differences after barely surviving their unlucky encoun- ter with the Eye-Fivers and Trip-J. With a bright future ahead, they are getting boisterous and draw the attention of a group of Crimson Crush orks. The orks tell them to take it elsewhere, Oda tells them to frag off, and a fight kicks off. To start it, everyone rolls Initiative, rolling their Initiative Dice and adding the total of the dice to their base Initiative Rating. Here’s how everyone looks. Oda has Reaction 6 and Intuition 3, providing him with an Initiative rank of 9. He has 1 Initiative Die and rolls 1. Adding the die result of 1 to his base Initiative of 9 gives him a final Initiative Score of 10. Carson Aims has Reaction 5 and Intuition 5. He has 2 Initiative Dice thanks to his wired reflexes and rolls 9. Adding the dice total of 9 to his base Initiative rank of 10 gives him a final Initiative Score of 19. Crimson Crush ganger A has Reaction 2 and Intuition 2, providing him with an Initiative rank of 4. He has 1 Initiative Die and rolls 6. Adding the die result of 6 to his base Initiative Rating of 4 gives him a final Initiative of 10. Crimson Crush gangers B, C, and D are operating as a grunt group with Reaction 2 and Intuition 2, providing them with an Initiative rank of 4. They have 1 Initiative Die and roll a 4. Adding the dice total of 4 to their base Initiative Score of 4 gives them a final Initiative of 8. The fight will start with Carson Aims at 19. When they reach 10, we see Oda and the Crimson Crush ganger tied, so we need to roll over to the tiebreaker and ask ERIC (Edge, Reaction, Intuition, coin flip). Comparing Edge, we find Oda has 5, while Crimson Crush ganger A only has 3 from his Professional Rat- ing. The tie is broken and Oda will go first, followed by the Crimson Crush ganger. The grunt group of Crimson Crush gangers will go last on 8.</p>
<p class="calibre1">INITIATIVE // COMBAT</p>
<p class="calibre1">108</p>
<p class="calibre1">Surprise Combat may start without all of the people involved knowing what’s happening. In these cas- es, some characters might be surprised, giving the other characters the drop on them. In a situation where one side is trying to surprise the other, use Surprise tests. To determine Surprise, roll a Reaction + Intu- ition (3) test. The threshold for this test may be modified based on the different groups’ awareness of the overall situation, their perception of the area, the preparations made for the ambush, and so forth. Characters who are deliberately planning an ambush do not roll for surprise. Anyone who succeeds in this test may move on to rolling Initiative, and they can act normally in Initiative order. Those who fail this test also roll Initiative, but they cannot act or spend Edge in the first combat round. They still roll to defend against attacks and to soak damage, but they can- not take any actions on their own. Once that first combat round is over, they can act normally.</p>
<p class="calibre1">SURPRISE The Crimson Crush were not keen on getting a beat- down in a bar on their own turf. A few of them spot Oda on the street and make a call to a few chummers up the road who set up a little ambush. As Oda approaches, they spring the ambush and everyone makes a Surprise test. Oda rolls 9 dice, Reaction 6 + Intuition 3, and gets 3 hits, matching the threshold of the test. He’s not going to be surprised here. If he had, he would have had no actions in the first combat round, and he would have to hope the gangers didn’t beat him too badly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weapon/Armor Characteristics Attack Rating/Range This number is an amalgam of the power and penetration of a weapon. It is compared to an op- ponent’s Defense Rating and varies through each range category. Certain weapons are better at cer- tain ranges, and some are ineffective after a certain distance. If a weapon does not have an Attack Rat- ing in a certain range category, it cannot be used at that range. There are five range categories:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Close: 0-3 meters Every gun has this one, though some are actual- ly less effective here because they’re so bulky.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Near: 4-50 meters This is the sweet spot across the board. All</p>
<p class="calibre1">ranged weapons can get into this range. How ef- fective they are is a whole other question.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Medium: 51-250 meters You need some barrel length to be effective here. Some smaller arms can get here, but hitting a target falls more into the realm of trickery and magic than skill.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Far: 251-500 meters Welcome to the land of longarms. This is the place where size matters&mdash;well, at least the length of the barrel.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Extreme: 500+ Sure, your tricked-out Colt M-23 can get here, barely, but that Ranger Arms revels in these ranges.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Capacity This is the maximum number of rounds the gun holds and the type of loading mechanism it uses. The categories are: (c) clip, (m) internal magazine, (b) belt, (a) break action, (cy) cylinder, (z) muzzle loader.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Defense Boost This quality is on Armor and bumps up the De- fense Rating of a character. Most Defense Boosts from pieces of armor are not cumulative, though qualities, augmentations, and supplemental armor like helmets, shields, and pads can provide a little bump here and there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Defense Rating This reflects how tough that tin can or spider-silk kevlar blend you’re wearing is. This is a combina- tion of Armor Rating and Body, and it might be affected by qualities and gear. It is compared to the Attack Rating to see if you have enough of an advantage to earn some Edge.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Damage Value (DV) This is the base amount of damage done with a successful attack. This number gets modified by the hits on the Attack test and may change slightly with different ammunition.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Firing Mode These are the modes you can use while firing. Weapons can fire in Single Shot (SS), Semi-Automatic (SA), Burst Fire (BF), and Fully Automatic (FA) modes depending on the type of gun or the modifications that have been made. Each mode offers a little something in exchange for something else. Ever heard the phrase “Everything has a price”? Still applies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">COMBAT // WEAPON/ARMOR CHARACTERISTICS</p>
<p class="calibre1">SS: You fire a single bullet. There are no changes to a weapon’s attributes with a single shot. SA: You fire two rounds rapidly with two trigger pulls. Decrease the Attack Rating of your weapon by 2 and increase damage by 1. BF: You’ve got a fancy gun that pumps out mul- tiple rounds with a single trigger pull. You can fire four rounds in an attack. You can shoot a narrow burst, which decreases the Attack Rating by 4 and increases damage by 2, or make a wide burst and split your dice pool between two targets and count each as a SA-mode shot. Not Enough Rounds! If you don’t have enough rounds to complete the full four-round narrow burst, reduce the effects accordingly, with Attack Rating adjustment matching the number of rounds fired and the Damage Value dropping to a +1 as long as at least 2 rounds were fired. FA: This mode allows multiple attacks with- out using the Multiple Attack Minor Action. The shooter chooses to split their dice pool among any valid targets in range. This can be used to attack a slew of targets or even a single target with a series of small dice pools, with each hit doing the full damage of the weapon. This mode uses ten rounds and decreases the Attack Rating by 6.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Skill This is simply what skill is used with this weapon. Unless the gamemaster says otherwise, they use Agil- ity as the associated attribute for the Skill test (except for using Engineering to fire from vehices, which uses Logic).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Damage Types (Elemental, etc.) Certain weapons and attacks deliver damage besides simple kinetic energy transfer. These forms of attacks, such as flamethrowers, fireballs, light- ning bolts, tasers, and toxic waves to name a few, usually have a secondary and/or extended Status effect beyond the initial attack and damage result.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Electricity Getting zapped not only hurts, but it also seiz- es muscles and leaves a victim shaky from mus- cle tremors. If a character shakes off the damage, they’re all good, but if they suffer even a single box, the character gets the Zapped status for 2 combat rounds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chemical (acids, bases, caustics, etc.) Attacks that involve corrosive chemicals&mdash;acids, bases, caustics, toxins, etc.&mdash;tend to stick around and cause damage on subsequent rounds. Chemical</p>
<p class="calibre1">Melee Close Combat and Grunts Example Even though their leader is down, the rest of the gang isn’t giving up yet. A group of three close in on Oda, drawing heavy bike chains to give him a beat down, be- cause none of them are carrying guns. Let’s run through the steps of Close Combat!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step One: Grab Some Dice The Eye-Fivers are considered grunts and thus attack as a single group instead of three individual attacks. They use their Close Combat 2 + Agility 2 and get a +1 bonus for the extra attackers in their group for a total dice pool of 5. Oda defends with Reaction 6 + Intuition 3, for a dice pool of 9.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Two: Distribute Edge Here we compare the Attack Rating of the bike chain in the hands of the gangers (9; base Attack Rating of 7 + 2 for the bonus from the extra grunts&mdash;see p.&nbsp;114) to the Defense Rating of Oda (10; Body 6 + 4 for armor jacket) and see that no one has an advantage of greater than 4, meaning no one gets a bonus Edge. The dim alley situation hasn’t changed, and Oda still has the advantage of the low-light vision on his cy- bereyes. The problem is, this is still the same combat round, and Oda hit his 2 bonus Edge limit during his player turn. Oda gains no bonus Edge here. Finally, we look at any gear or qualities that might help either side but find nothing for either side in melee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Three: Roll Dice and Spend Edge The Eye-Fivers spend the 1 Edge they have from their Professional Rating to go for the Tumble Action rather than the standard damaging attack, looking for more of an advantage. This doesn’t alter their dice pool of 5, from which they get 2 hits. Oda decides to hold off on using any Edge, making his Defense test dice pool 9 (Reaction 6 + Intuition 3), which he botches terribly, managing 0 hits. He then de- cides to use his Edge to reroll a single die and manages to turn a 1 into a 5, giving him a single hit on the test. The gangers get 1 net hit (2 hits &ndash; 1 hit) and move on to Step 4.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Four: Soak Some Damage Oda rolls his Body against the modified Damage Val- ue of 3s (Base Damage Value of the Chain + 1 net hit). He gets 2 hits and reduces the damage to 1S.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Five: Bring the Pain Here we apply that 1 box of damage to the Stun Con- dition Monitor of Oda and then compare the net dam- age to Oda’s Body 6 to determine if he is knocked down. Much to the chagrin of the gangers, he maintains his footing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">109</p>
<p class="calibre1">WEAPON/ARMOR CHARACTERISTICS // COMBAT</p>
<p class="calibre1">110</p>
<p class="calibre1">attacks add the Corrosive status. Additionally, if the modified Damage Value of an attack exceeds the Armor of the target, the Defense boost from that piece of armor is permanently decreased by one after the attack is resolved.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cold No one likes being cold. The shakes, chattering teeth, hypothermia, and tissue damage are just a few reasons your life will be harder after you get hit by a cold-based attack. Taking damage from an attack with a Cold damage type inflicts the Chilled status for 3 combat rounds. Lastly, if the modified Damage Value of an attack exceeds the Armor of the target, the Defense boost from that piece of armor is permanently decreased by one after the attack is resolved.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fire Once you’re hit by an attack that involves fire, the fire ignites flammable objects, including you. This effect means the fire burns for several rounds after the first. Taking damage from an attack with a Fire damage type inflicts the Burning status. Gamemaster note: The damage and duration are subject to your discretion if the target has some mitigating circumstance. If they’re covered in oil or wearing a lot of loose-fitting cloth, it may last longer, cause more damage, or require a higher threshold to extinguish.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Combat Options Edge Actions (p.&nbsp;47) provide some addition- al options to use in combat, but here are a few more that don’t require any expenditure of Edge.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Off-Hand Attacks Every shadowrunner has a preferred hand to use in attacks (except those with the Ambidex- trous quality, p.&nbsp;70), but sometimes that hand isn’t available. Maybe your preferred hand is damaged, or cuffed, or holding something really important, so you have to attack with a weapon in your off-hand. When attacking with your off- hand, you can neither gain nor use Edge. If you’re attacking with two hands, the attack from your primary hand can still gain and spend Edge; for other rules, see Multiple Attacks below.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Knockdown Sometimes you want to knock an opponent on their hoop&mdash;and sometimes you do that without meaning to. Whenever a character is damaged, if the amount of damage left after their Damage Resistance test is greater than their Body rank,</p>
<p class="calibre1">COMBAT // COMBAT OPTIONS</p>
<p class="calibre1">then they are knocked down and gain the Prone status. They’ll have to use a Stand Up action if they want to remove the effects of the Prone status.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grapple A physical attack can involve trying to bring an opponent to the ground, or trying to hold on to them so they can’t move. If you want to grap- ple with an opponent, inform your gamemaster what you’re doing, then make an unarmed Close Combat + Agility test. Instead of making the net hits into damage, the attacker rolls Strength + net hits vs.&nbsp;opponent’s Strength. If they succeed in this test, they have wrapped up and restrained the op- ponent. The only physical actions the opponent can take are attempts to break out of the grapple, though spellcasters and technomancers can use their Magic and Resonance abilities, respectively. All attackers, including the grappler, automatically gains Edge on a restrained defender, and the de- fender also experiences a &ndash;4 dice pool penalty on their Defense test. Note, however, that any missed attack on the restrained individual may hit the grappler instead. Have the grappler make a De- fense test against the same attack roll, as if they were the intended target. Here are some of the actions that can happen after the grapple is engaged. All of them are Major Actions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Attacker Restrain: The attacker may simply opt to keep holding the defender. Use the attacker’s unarmed Attack Rating, and roll Close Combat + Strength vs.&nbsp;Close Combat + Strength. The &ndash;4 dice pool penalty applies to the defender. Damage the opponent: The attacker may at- tempt to inflict damage on the defender with a Close Combat + Strength vs.&nbsp;Strength + Reaction. The attacker’s unarmed Attack Rating is used, and the defender suffers the &ndash;4 dice pool penal- ty for being restrained. If the attack is successful, the attacker does their unarmed combat damage (Strength/2, rounded up) plus net hits. Tackle the opponent: The attacker may decide to bring the opponent to the ground. This is a Close Combat + Strength vs.&nbsp;Body + Strength test. The attacker uses their unarmed Attack Rating, and the defender does not suffer the dice pool penalty for being restrained. If the attack succeeds, the defend- er is brought to the ground, becoming Prone, and suffers Stun damage equal to their attacker’s Body + net hits, resisted by Body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Defender Break free: In this action, the defender tries to break out of the grapple. This is a Close Combat +</p>
<p class="calibre1">Strength test, using their unarmed Attack Rating, and it does not experience the &ndash;4 dice pool penalty for being restrained. If they succeed in the test, they do not do any damage, but they are free of the grapple.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Multiple Attacks Whether it’s shooting a bunch of bullets at mul- tiple people, throwing shuriken at a marauding group, or using a sword in each hand, there may be times you want to deliver multiple attacks at once. This can be against multiple targets, or you could attempt two attacks against the same tar- get. Whatever the case, to make multiple attacks, divide your attacking dice pool by the number of attacks made as evenly as possible, then make the rolls. If you are making two different kinds of attack (like, say, a gun in one hand, a knife in the other) divide each of your normal dice pools by two, rounded down. Defenders will defend as normal; if the multiple attacks are made against a single target, they only have to roll once, and their hits will be compared to all of the attacker’s rolls to determine success.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Barriers Getting a wall or some other obstruction be- tween an incoming attack and your squishy person is a great idea. The barrier has two primary effects: making it harder to hit you and making it hard- er to hurt you, by providing Cover and Structure, respectively. All Barriers also use their Structure rating to determine the difficulty of making larger holes, either to shoot through or move through. In order to hurt you, someone’s got to hit you. A key factor in hitting any target is the size. “Can’t hit the broad side of a troll” is a saying for a reason. When a target is partially covered, you have a small- er area to hit as part of them is unseen behind the Cover. The only way to gain the advantage of Cover is to use the Take Cover Minor Action. By having some form of cover available and taking the Action, you gain the Cover Status effect based on the size of you, the cover, and your choice of posture. The Cov- er rating is based on how much of your body you can put behind the cover while still effectively re- turning attacks and ducking back in if you need to. Take Cover assumes you are planning or desir- ing to return fire. If you’re just hiding back there, the rules are a little different. Any time you’re com- pletely behind an object and you get hit, you gain the benefits of the Structure rating of the material. This can be anything from a pane of glass to a fer- rocrete reinforced bunker taking the punch out of incoming attacks for you. Subtract half the Struc- ture rating (rounded up) from the incoming un- modified damage. Anything left over gets the extra hits from the Attack Test and needs to be resisted.</p>

<p class="calibre1">BARRIERS // COMBAT</p>
<p class="calibre1">112</p>
<p class="calibre1">Breaking Through To break a larger hole in a barrier, you need to use an Attack Action or series of Attack Actions with a weapon that has a Damage Value that meets or exceeds one half the Structure rating. Explosives get an advantage on this, as does full-auto gunfire, as well as certain melee weapons (hammer, axe, pick, etc.). For regular firearms and non-specialized me- lee weapons, compare the base Damage Val- ue (DV) to the Structure rating. As long as the base DV is at least half the Structure rating, the weapon creates a one-centimeter-diameter hole in the structure. If the base DV is more than half or equal to the Structure rating, the hole is two centimeters in diameter. If the base DV is great- er than the Structure rating, the hole’s diameter grows by one centimeter for every point of DV greater than Structure rating. Weapons firing in SS mode can create a single hole per attack. SA weapons can create 2 holes per Attack action. Burst Fire creates one hole per Attack but gains the DV boost from a narrow burst. Full Auto is a special case that needs a new paragraph. Full-auto gunfire can be used to make single attack and create a ten-centimeter-diameter hole with each Attack Action made on the barrier as long as the base Damage Value of the weapon is greater than the Structure rating. If the Damage Value is between half the Structure rating and the full Structure rating, the Attack Action makes a five-centimeter-diameter hole. Less than half and nothing happens but a lot of ricocheting rounds. Specialized melee weapons, including axes, picks, and hammers, gain a little boost. Make a Strength Test and use the hits to modify the base DV of the Weapon and create a modified Damage Value. These weapons can make a five-centime- ter-diameter hole if the modified Damage Value is at least half the Structure rating but less than the full Structure rating. They can be used to make a ten-centimeter-diameter hole with each Attack Ac- tion if their modified Damage Value is equal to the Structure rating. For every point greater than the Structure rating, the hole’s diameter grows by one centimeter. Weapons with a Damage Value of less than half the Structure rating cannot penetrate. Explosives are designed to blow through bar- riers, but not all explosives are created equally. Grenades, rockets, and missiles all use an explo- sion to project shrapnel to damage soft targets and their Damage Values reflect that. Commer- cial explosives are designed to blow stuff up (like barriers) and are treated differently (p.&nbsp;117). For Grenades, Rockets, and Missiles, use their Close Range damage when determining Structure dam- age. Conventional explosives get their full boom potential. For the basics: Compare the Damage Value</p>
<ol start="505" class="calibre6">
<li class="calibre3">of the explosive in use to the Structure rating, as usual. If the DV is less than half of the Structure rating, the blast doesn’t penetrate. Normal explo- sive rules apply, and folks in the Blast Radius who don’t have cover can still take damage. If the DV is between one-half the Structure rating and the full Structure rating, the explosion creates a hole approximately a half meter in diameter. If the DV matches the Structure rating, the hole is 1 square meter, and for every point of DV that it exceeds the Structure rating, the hole is one-half square meter larger. If the Damage Value doubles the Structure rating, they destroy 10 square meters of the Struc- ture (basically a three meter by three meter hole). When any explosion destroys a barrier, it cre- ates a cloud of deadly shrapnel that threatens an area beyond the structure. The shrapnel from this blast has a DV equal to the explosive’s DV minus the Structure rating of the barrier, with a Blast Ra- dius equal to the modified DV/2. After all is said and done, if the gamemaster thinks the hole that was made is large enough to compromise the structural integrity of a larger sec- tion, they can have the entire structure collapse. This could mean a door shatters, a wall crumbles, or even an entire building comes crashing down because its support structures were demolished.</li>

<p class="calibre1">Shooting a Barrier: Gun and Wooden Door EXAMPLE Cottonmouth needs line of sight on some incoming guards, but Carson Aims just closed the door. Luckily, Cottonmouth is a creative Snake shaman. He pulls out his Colt Manhunter and screws the silencer on then puts a single round into the solid wood door between the team and the security goons. We compare the base DV of the Manhunter (4P) to the Structure rating of the door (7) and see that the DV is more than half the Structure rating, giving Cottonmouth a two-centimeter-diameter hole to peek through.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shooting a Barrier: Full Auto and Wooden Door EXAMPLE Ahead, Grizzly encounters another door, but this one is locked. In no mood to ask Codey B to deal with the electronic lock or Carson to pick it, Grizzly pulls out his trusty AK-97 and deals with the door his own way, with a couple of well-placed Full Auto blasts. It’s another solid wood door with a Structure rating of 7. The AK-97 has a base DV of 5P. Comparing the base DV to the Struc- ture rating we see it isn’t equal, but it is greater than half. This tears a five-centimeter-diameter hole, with the player declaring the hole is around the handle in hopes of wrecking the lock. Note: The gamemaster can call for an Engineering + Logic roll to decide if a character knows the weak points on a door.</p>
<p class="calibre1">COMBAT // BARRIERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shooting a Barrier: Full Auto and Metal Door example Through the first door and running fast up on another, Grizzly raises the AK and sends another Full Auto blast at the same spot. The AK has a DV of 5P, but Grizzly doesn’t realize this next door has a metal core, bumping its Struc- ture rating to 11. The DV of the attack doesn’t exceed half the Structure rating, giving Grizzly a whole lot of rico- cheting rounds and a door that is still quite operational as they charge forward into it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Breaking a Barrier: Elbow and Glass example Grizzly slings the AK as he sees a fire axe in a glass case on a wall near the door. Having seen too many trids, he decides to slam an elbow into the glass. He’s a bur- ly ork, and his aluminum bone lacing gives him a base DV of 4P. We compare that to the Structure rating of thin glass (2). He meets the Structure rating and beats it by 2, making the hole 4 centimeters in diameter rather than 2. The gamemaster decides this is enough to compromise the structure of the thin glass, and it all shatters around Grizzly’s elbow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Breaking a Barrier: Axe and Metal Door example Axe in hand, Grizzly goes after the door with the metal core. Since the axe is a specialized weapon for chopping through things, Grizzly makes a Strength test. With his 6 dice, he gets 2 hits. Those 2 hits add onto the base DV of 5P to give a modified DV of 7P for the axe against the door. Compare the DV of 7P to the Structure rating of 11, and it is over half but not equal. Metal core be damned, he manages to hack another five-centimeter-diameter hole around the lock, and the team has another obstacle out of the way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Breaking a Barrier: Explosives and Plastiboard EXAMPLE Thanks to some unreliable intel provided by Mr.&nbsp;Johnson, the runners have reached a dead end and have a pack of security goons hot on their tail. The gun- bunnies focus on keeping security at bay while Byom, the mad Russian bombmaker, starts checking out the wall that he thinks is either external or leads to a ga- rage level. Either way, if he can make a hole in it, they can keep moving. Borrowing the axe from Grizzly, Byom easily makes a five-centimeter hole in the plastiboard (DV 5P vs.&nbsp;Structure 6) without even swinging hard. It is enough to reveal the concrete on the other side. Byom knows his materials and pulls out a Rating 12 explo- sive package. He tucks the charge into the open wall hole and does some other demolitions planning with an Engineering 6 + Logic 5 test, getting 4 hits on the 11 dice. This bumps the effective rating up to 16. Com- paring rating 16 with the Structure 15, we find we have exceeded the Structure by 1. This makes a one-square- meter hole for equaling the Structure rating, plus an additional half square meter for the one point above the rating, so the hole is 1.5 square meters. It will be a tight squeeze for Grizzly, but everyone will be able to make it through without a problem. Note: Prior to setting off the charge, Byom warned everyone on his side to take cover or go prone in or- der to prevent damage from backblast and such. If the Structure rating had been too high or the Explosive DV too low to allow penetration, the blast would have redi- rected into the room, requiring Damage Soak tests by the runner team.</p>
<p class="calibre1">falling damage When a character falls more than three meters, they take Physical damage with a Damage Value equal to half of the meters fallen, resisted by Body. The gam- emaster should feel free to adjust the damage based on relevant circumstances.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Grunt Groups To speed up combat a little, we recommend that grunts attack as a group or groups rather than as a series of individuals. This saves on dice rolls while also showing the greater chance of success with a group working together. The gamemaster chooses the size of the grunt groups, usually grouping them by who they’re attacking and/or type of attack. If four Lone Star troopers have clubs out and two have drawn their guns, the four club wielders work together, while the pistol packers pair up on the perp of their choice. For a group of grunts, determine the highest At- tack test dice pool and Attack Rating of its mem- bers. These are the base ratings for the group. Each additional member of the group adds 1 to the At- tack Rating. For every odd-numbered member of the group beyond the first, add 1 die to the Attack test dice pool. Using these new values, they make a single Group Attack test. For logistical purposes, a group of grunts mak- ing an attack shouldn’t be more than 5, as larger groups than that tend to just get each other’s way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">GRUNT GROUP example Four Lone Star Patrol Officers wielding clubs are ready to give some sad ganger a beat-down. They all have similar stats, but the ork among them is a bit beef- ier, giving them a base Attack Rating of 8 and Attack test dice pool of 6 (Close Combat 4 + Agility 2). Operat- ing as a grunt group, their new Attack Rating is 11 (Base 8 + 3 for additional members) and Attack test dice pool is 7 (base 6 + 1 for the third cop). If there were 5 Lone Star Patrol Officers, they’d gain another point to their Attack Rating and another die in the Attack test dice pool.</p>
<p class="calibre1">FILLER ART</p>
<p class="calibre1">Explosives, Gases, and Spray Things that go boom or affect a wide area need a special set of rules. Area-effect weapons come in three forms: spray, blast, and gas. Spray weapons are things like flamethrowers, nausea guns, and fire extinguishers. Blast weapons include grenades, mortars, rockets, and all things that explode. Gas weapons are those that release a gas into the imme- diate vicinity over time. Setting up explosives for a specific purpose, like using a demolition charge to blow a door off its hinges, is covered in the last section, Building a Bigger Boom (p.&nbsp;117).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blast Attacks and Scatter Attacks that have the Blast effect vary their damage from the point of origin. Each Blast At- tack has a damage effect at Ground Zero (within 1 meter of the explosion), Close (1&ndash;3), and Near (4&ndash;50) range. Medium, Far, and Extreme are too big for this book’s handheld explosive and shoul- der-fired weapons. Most explosives are listed with a maximum blast radius. If no maximum is listed, they get everything within a fifty-meter radius. Attacks occur as usual, with a Weapon Skill + Agility test to land the explosive device where they want, with each hit decreasing how far it scatters from the point of impact. To determine scatter, the gamemaster rolls 2D6 and consults the Scatter at Range table. This table tells them how many me- ters the grenade scatters, through a combination of throw inaccuracy, bouncing, and defender action. Then the gamemaster rolls 2D6 again to determine the scatter direction, consulting the Scatter Direc- tion Diagram. The orientation of the diagram is based on the the direction the attack is initially traveling. Once the gamemaster knows the direc- tion and distance of the scatter, they can then re- solve the explosion, using the Damage Values at the various range increments. Defending against Blast Attacks is a little dif- ferent. Characters targeted by an attack&mdash;basically anyone in the blast radius of the attack&mdash;can use an Avoid Incoming Minor Action (if they have one available) to attempt to get away from the blast. Without this action damage is resisted as normal, though a Hit the Dirt action can also be used to decrease the Damage Value by 2.</p>

<p class="calibre1">grenades EXAMPLE After assessing the pinweight threat level of these gang- ers, street heavyweight Oda decides he has the time to teach them all a harsh lesson of the streets about fighting out of your weight class by tossing a grenade into their bikes parked at the end of the alley.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step One: Grab Some Dice Oda rolls Athletics 3 + Agility 7 for his throwing attempt. This attack goes after a location rather than an individual, but anyone within the Blast radius, or who thinks they might be in the Blast radius, can use an Avoid Incoming Minor Ac- tion to make a Move as long as they haven’t used the Move or Sprint action this turn. The three gangers that attacked used a Move Minor Action to close the distance, but two more of them held back in reserve and haven’t used any actions yet. Those two will use the Avoid Incoming action and hopefully get some distance from the boom!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Two: Distribute Edge We compare Oda’s unarmed Attack Rating of 12 for thrown grenades, to the Defense Rating of the bikes (6; Body 4 + Ar- mor 2) giving Oda an advantage greater than 4, meaning he gets a bonus Edge. The dim alley situation hasn’t changed, but that just means he can see his target location, nothing more. He’s not battling the gangers in a direct way, so we don’t even worry about them. Finally, we look at any gear or qualities that might help either side but find nothing in this case.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Three: Roll Dice and Spend Edge Oda saves his Edge for later, just in case this move doesn’t scare the gangers off. He makes his attack roll with a dice</p>
<p class="calibre1">pool of 10 and gets 4 hits. As this is a throwing attack at a location, it has a chance of scatter. When making a throw- ing attack at Near range, the scatter is 2D6 &ndash; (net hits + 2) meters. The gamemaster secretly rolls for Scatter and gets 7, then subtracts the 6 (4 net hits +2), resulting in a one-meter scatter. They also roll another 2D6 and consult the Scatter Direction Diagram to see which way the grenade scatters (11, indicating a meter short and right of the target). Still close enough to the bikes and the gangers. Those Eye-Fivers bolt in a direction of their choice. One moves toward the brawl, the other moves toward the bikes screaming “Noooooo!” as he predicts what’s coming and thinks he may be able to save his bike. Both move more than 6 meters and will gain the Prone status for the Damage Re- sistance test based on the rules of the Avoid Incoming action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Four: Soak Some Damage For explosions, we need to know what the damage is for everyone involved. High-explosive grenades have a damage code of 14P/10P/6P (Ground Zero, Close, and Near, respec- tively) and a Blast radius of 10 meters. There are six motorcy- cles and one ganger within the blast radius (the one who ran toward the melee got clear. Two motorcycles are at Ground Zero, the other four are Close, and the ganger’s foolhar- dy choice put him at Ground Zero as well. The motorcycles roll Body 4 because they’re vehicles, and the gamemaster decides to roll them all with a single roll, getting 3 hits. The ganger rolls Body 3 and gets 1 hit. Time to move on to Step 5.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Five: Bring the Pain The two motorcycles at Ground Zero take 11 boxes of dam- age and are destroyed. The four in Close range take 7 boxes to their Condition Monitor. The ganger suffers 13 boxes of dam- age and heads off to the great gang war in the sky.</p>

<p class="calibre1">grenade launcher example A funny thing happened when that grenade exploded. Several bits of shrapnel scratched the paint on a nearby Eu- rocar Westwind, belonging to none other than Carson Aims, a runner of some renown. Carson isn’t happy about some Redmond rumble nicking his paint and decides to just end the fight for everyone. He goes to his trunk and pulls the MGL-6, a grenade launcher, from its case and puts a frag- mentation grenade into the end of the alley and the bikes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step One: Grab Some Dice Carson Aims uses his Exotic Weapons (Grenade Launch- er) 3 + Agility 3 + 1 (he has a wireless-enabled smartgun system on the MGL-6), for a total dice pool of 7. A fragmen- tation grenade has a blast of 20 meters, putting everyone in the alley and all the bikes once again in range of the blast. Oda still has a Minor Action left, and he hasn’t used a Move action, so he can use the Avoid Incoming action to get out when he hears the distinctive “thoomp” noise of the launcher. All the gangers have used either the Move or Avoid Incoming action already, so they’re going to be tak- ing this hit right on the nose.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Two: Distribute Edge We compare the Attack Rating of the MGL-6 grenade launcher, which is 8, to the Defense Rating of the bikes (7; Body 4 + Armor 3), the gangers (4; Body 3 + leathers 1), and Oda (10; Body 6 + armor jacket 4). When dealing with groups or Area Effect attacks, compare the Attack Rating to the highest Defense Rating among all the targets for the Edge bonus. Since Carson Aims does not have an ad- vantage greater than 4 over everyone, he does not get a bonus Edge. The dim alley is traded for a poorly lit street, but there is now smoke pouring from wrecked bikes, making it a little tough for Carson to see anyone specific, providing an Edge for the gangers and Oda. Finally, we look at any gear or qualities that might help either side but see nothing in this case.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gas Attacks Gas attacks have three attributes: Range, Con- centration, and DV. They spread and decrease their effectiveness over distance and aren’t instant ef- fects. The basic Attack has a Concentration rating that spreads over a range to build effectiveness but isn’t slowed or stopped by going around barriers. If it fills a space with limited ventilation, the Con- centration builds. The diffusion of a gas attack is based on the time that passes and the distance from the initial point of dispersion. The Range statistic of the at- tack determines the area where the attack has full effect; beyond that range, the effect is lessened&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Three: Roll Dice and Spend Edge Carson kicks off the rolling and manages a whopping 0 hits. Luckily, he has some Edge and decides to activate the 4-Edge Boost to re-roll his failures. His re-roll goes great and gets him 2 hits. As this is a launched weapon attack at a lo- cation, it has a chance to scatter. When making a launched attack into Near Range, the scatter is 2D6 &ndash; (net hits) me- ters. The gamemaster secretly rolls for Scatter and gets 8. Carson is a pro and uses pro equipment, meaning he has the airburst feature on the grenade and gets to double his hits for the purpose of reducing scatter. We take the 10 meters of scatter, subtract 4 meters (2 x net hits) and gets 4 meters. Another 2D6 comes up as 7, and the grenade travels a little extra distance into the alley before detonating. Oda is pretty sure he’s not far from the maximum edge of the blast and the corner wall of the alley. He chooses to move 5 meters around the corner and ends up prone, be- cause he exceeded two meters of movement on the Avoid Incoming action, but he is safely out of the Blast Radius and out of harm’s way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Four: Soak Some Damage Here it gets ugly. The damage codes for a fragmenta- tion grenade are 16P/12P/8P. Nothing is at Ground Zero. A bike is in the Close range (12P), with the remaining 4 gang- ers, two bikes, and the gang leader all in Near range (8P). Rolling (Body 4) for the bikes gets 1 hit. The three who were laying the chain to Oda and the one who ran from the first grenade roll together (Body 3) and get 1 hit. The gang lead- er rolls Body 4 and manages 2 hits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Five: Bring the Pain Let’s start with the easy one. Oda didn’t even roll be- cause he was around the corner and out of the blast range. The bike in Close range is toast, taking 12 boxes of dam- age on top of the 7 it already had. The two bikes in Near take 6 boxes each (7 &ndash; 1), but add that to the 7 they already took, and these Eye-Fivers aren’t going to bring much “go” to their go-gang right now. The four Eye-Fivers will take 6 boxes each and call it quits for this fight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gas Ranges, Effect, and Duration</p>
<p class="calibre1">Range 1&ndash;5 6&ndash;8 9&ndash;10 11+ Range x 2 &mdash; 1&ndash;5 6&ndash;8 9+ Range x 3 &mdash; 1&ndash;4 5&ndash;6 7+ Range x 4 &mdash; &mdash; 1&ndash;5 6+</p>
<p class="calibre1">either half the full effect, one quarter, or no effect. Any fractional effects should be rounded down. The Gas Effects table shows the different ranges where the gas has an effect, how strong that effect</p>
<p class="calibre1">COMBAT // EXPLOSIVES, GASES, AND SPRAY</p>
<p class="calibre1">is, and how long it lasts. The rounds listed in that chart refer to the number of rounds after the initial attack lands. If the attack is stopped by a solid barrier, the Concentration builds to full during the first 5 rounds and doesn’t decrease until rounds 9 and 10. If the attack is stopped in a sealed space, Con- centration builds through round 5 and doesn’t de- crease until it goes inert in round 10.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gas Grenade Example It’s been one of those days for Oda, and he’s found himself in the middle of a public demonstration. The crowd around him, all dressed in Humanis Policlub gear, has been getting louder and louder with their threats, so Oda decides to fire a random shot into the air in hopes of creating a positive counter-response to the bigotry of the HP. The local Knight Errant officers respond by firing a se- ries of gas grenades into the crowd. Unsure of which way to go, Oda holds still, waiting for the canisters to hit the ground and disperse before deciding which way to run. If he had chosen to, he could have taken an Avoid Incoming action and picked a way to bolt, but in the dense crowd his options would have been limited. Three Knight Errant officers fire grenades in a wide arc. The grenade in the center is 20 meters into the center of the crowd. The grenade to the left is 10 meters from the center grenade, the grenade to the right is 20 meters from the center grenade. These gas grenades have a range of 5 and begin spray- ing gas out in a 20-meter radius (Range x 4). Oda is out- side the area of effect, but if he moves toward the crowd within the next five rounds, he’ll have to deal with one quarter of the gas’ usual effect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spray Attacks The beauty of a weapon like a flamethrower is, if the target is in range, it’s pretty hard to miss it. The question is, how much of the blast did they take, and how wide an area are you trying to cov- er? Those are the things to know when determin- ing who is healthy and who is flambéed. When making a spray attack, chose one of three styles: straight, wobbly, or sweeping. A straight attack is what it sounds like, an attempt to fire straight at a target. A wobbly attack moves back and forth a little, covering an area about three me- ters wide. A sweeping attack moves across a ten- meter-wide area. A straight attack is handled as normal, with no modifications to Attack Rating or Damage Value. Anyone who happens into the path of the spray while it is being fired will also be affected. A wob- bly attack is more difficult to avoid, but the effect is diminished&mdash;increase the Attack Rating by 2 for this attack but reduce the DV by 1. A sweeping</p>
<p class="calibre1">attack only amplifies this tendency&mdash;increase the Attack Rating by 4, but reduce the DV by 3. On either a wobbly or sweeping attack, you can elect to move the stream extra fast. You substitute the wild die for one of the normal dice from your dice pool.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Building a Bigger Boom Explosives can be set and designed to increase their effectiveness by directing their blast and shrapnel all in one specific direction in order to create a specific effect, like removing a wall or shredding an advancing force. Explosive weapons, such as grenades, rockets, and missiles, are all de- signed around the idea that they explode and send shrapnel into soft targets to do damage. They ar- en’t designed for demolitions work, but with a lit- tle effort can work in a pinch. The same goes the other direction with conventional explosives. They aren’t made to kill personnel, but with a little inge- nuity, they work when needed. All those efforts are handled through a Dem- olitions test using Engineering + Logic. There are three ways to use this test that involve increasing the Damage Value of the explosive weapons and commercial explosives against a particular kind of target: personnel or structural. Here goes! To increase explosive weapons damage against personnel, make an Engineering + Logic (2) Test. Each hit above the threshold adds 1 to the DV of the explosive weapon at one of the Range Categories. Multiple hits can increase the DV in a single range category or be divided among several range catego- ries. In order to do this, the explosive weapon needs to be set up at a specific location. This test cannot be used on a weapon with the intention of increasing the damage after being thrown or launched. This is all about planting these weapons in a specific way that maximizes the damage they cause. Explosive weapons always use their Close Range Damage Value against Structures. To in- crease explosive weapons damage on a structure, make an Engineering + Logic (2) test. Each hit above the threshold increases the Close range DV for the purposes of damaging a Structure by 1. The DV can never be increased beyond the Ground Zero DV, no matter how many hits are rolled. Conventional explosives are primarily used to damage structures, but metahumankind has come up with many ways to have them hurt body struc- tures. You can use the Engineering skill to prepare explosives, identify key or weak structural points, and focus the blast in a particular direction or arc. Each hit on an Engineering + Logic test adds 1 to the conventional explosive’s effective rating when applied to Structure ratings. There is no threshold here, as this is exactly what these types of explo- sives were designed for. If looking to apply more personnel damage with conventional explosives,</p>

<p class="calibre1">Exotic Weapons and Spray example</p>
<p class="calibre1">118</p>
<p class="calibre1">The worst thing about the Redmond Barrens is the level of crazy in its residents. From his second-floor apartment, Halloweener wannabe Joseph Jonas Jones&mdash;Trip-J to his street homies&mdash;hears the commotion and decides to test out his homemade flamethrower. He strolls over, sees Car- son Aims below, and squeezes the trigger.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step One: Grab Some Dice Trip-J will be using his Exotic Weapons (Flamethrower) 1 + Agility 2 for a whopping dice pool of 3 dice. Carson Aims will definitely be looking to evade that incoming flame, roll- ing Reaction 5 + Intuition 5 to avoid getting roasted. There is one other target in the sweep, that beautiful car, but it has no way of avoiding the attack and won’t get a roll until Step 4.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Two: Distribute Edge That flamethrower has an Attack Rating of 9, but Trip-J is going to do a little wobbly spray and up that by 2, getting an 11, compared to the Defense Rating of Carson Aims (7; Body 5 + armor clothing 2). We see that Trip-J wins by 4 and gets a bonus Edge. The surprise attack from above seems a decent rea- son for a bonus Edge going Trip-J’s way, upping it to 2 Edge. As for gear or qualities, nothing again, especially with this street newb and his home-built flambé machine.</p>
<p class="calibre1">apply a threshold of 2 to the above test. Whether the test is about finding a weak point or packing the explosive in a can of nails is based on which effect the character is trying to create. They need to decide in advance, as they can’t have it both ways. An explosive’s Damage Value is based on its rat- ing, which is an amalgam of the explosive’s power and quanity, all without specifically defining either. The rating is used as a base DV against Structures. As a weapon against personnel, each explosive package has the following DV: Ground Zero: Rat- ing, Close: Rating/2, Near: Rating/4; Blast Radius: Rating. Explosives of different ratings can be merged together only if they are in the same Rating Class (the classes are 1&ndash;3, 4&ndash;6, 7&ndash;9, 10&ndash;12, etc.) and merge at a rate of 1:1. Beyond each Rating Class, the quantities and compositions of the explosives just don’t blend well. (Plus we don’t want anyone cheating the system by just buying thousands of low-rating explosives to build a nuclear weapon out of M-80s.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Three: Roll Dice and Spend Edge Trip-J is going for broke and decides to move the sweep extra fast and swaps one of his dice for a wild die. Go big or go home! He rolls his 3 dice, getting one normal hit, plus a hit on the wild die (worth 3 total hits), and then uses those 2 bonus Edge to bump the 4 he rolled on the failed die up to a 5 for another hit, for a total of 5 hits. Carson tosses 10 dice and manages 3 hits. Getting hit with a flamethrower is not on his to-do list, so he drops all 4 of his Edge to reroll his 7 failed dice, but he only gets 1 more hit. This leaves Trip-J with 1 net hit on Carson and all 5 on that Westwind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Four: Soak Some Damage Carson rolls Body 6 against the modified Damage Value of the flamethrower, 3P (Base 3P &ndash; 1 sweeping + 1 net hit). He gets 2 hits. Things are not looking good. The Westwind rolls Body x 2 (8) against the modified Damage Value of the flamethrower, 7P (Base 3P &ndash; 1 sweep- ing + 5 net hits). The car manages 5 hits. Head to step 5 and see how bad this really is!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step Five: Bring the Pain Carson takes 1 box of Physical Damage and gains the Burning status. The Westwind takes 2 boxes, and it is also Burning. This is not a good day for Carson.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Environment and Visibility Many circumstances of lighting or environment may affect combat. One character may have better visibility than another, or may have the advantage of the high ground, or have better footing. If one character has clear advantage over their opponent, they gain a point of Edge. There is not a defini- tive list of the circumstances in which Edge may be gained. As a guideline, consider low-light cir- cumstances where one character has either low- light vision or thermographic vision and the other combatant does not. The character with the vision enhancement should gain an Edge in that circum- stance. Any other time a combatant has a similar advantage, they should gain Edge (remembering the two-Edge-per-combat-round limit).</p>

<p class="calibre1">COMBAT // ENVIRONMENT AND VISIBILITY</p>
<p class="calibre1">Healing We’ve explained to you how to put the hurt on, so now let’s talk about getting the hurt off. Healing in Shadowrun is a mix of in-the-field first aid, miraculous magic, futuristic tech, and heroic speeds of natural re- covery. Getting back in the fight is a lot more fun than lying in a hospital bed for weeks or months. The first thing to cover is the order of operations for healing. Do you need to apply first aid before magic or after? Can you magically heal someone who’s already been treated by a medkit? The answer is simple: The or- der doesn’t matter, except that Overflow damage heals first. Every character gets multiple chances to get patched up before they’re stuck carrying around their injuries for days. The key here is how soon each needs to be applied. Details are under each description below.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First Aid Biotech + Logic (5 - Essence) As implied by the name, this is probably the first aid you should apply because it has the narrowest window. After the end of a combat encounter in which a character was injured, they have 1 minute (20 combat rounds if another fight kicks off) to receive First Aid. To apply First Aid, a character needs the right tools for the job, in this case a first aid kit. Any test made with- out a kit suffers a &ndash;2 dice pool modifier, and no Edge can be spent on the test. Make a Biotech + Logic test against a threshold equal to 5 &ndash; target’s Essence. If the target is one-hundred-per- cent natural, the healer actually gets an automatic hit added to what they roll. This represents the difficulty of repairing someone who has metal parts as well as those with organs not normally found in average people. Hits above the necessary threshold can be used to heal one box of Stun Damage (not including drain) per hit or one box of Physical Damage or Overflow per 2 hits. Drain cannot be healed with First Aid. A character can receive First Aid only once for any single set of injuries.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Medkit Biotech + Logic (5 - Essence) Medkits are more detailed. The patient must be con- nected to medkit monitors and diagnosed, after which they receive injections and IVs. After the end of a combat encounter in which a character is injured, they have one hour to be connected to a medkit or get medical atten- tion from a trained professional with a medkit. If they wait beyond this period, a medkit will not help them. It takes one minute to hook up the patient, get the medkit to spit out a diagnosis, and begin treatment. The healing process takes one minute per box healed (so, if the process is interrupted, you know how many boxes were patched up). Each time a medkit is used, it con- sumes one batch of supplies. Treatment cannot be at- tempted if no medkit supplies remain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">119</p>
<p class="calibre1">HEALING // COMBAT</p>
<p class="calibre1">120</p>
<p class="calibre1">Healing example Carson Aims has been through the ringer. As his team escapes in their van, he lies unconscious in the back (10 boxes of Stun, 11 boxes of Physical, and 2 Overflow) being attended to by Candyman, the team’s medic, and Cotton- mouth, their Snake shaman and a skilled healer. Candyman can see that Aims is in bad shape, and he decides to admin- ister first aid before his sixty-second window closes, but the jostling van is going to make it rough. Candyman opens with a First Aid test. He rolls Biotech 5 + Logic 4 with a threshold of 2 (5 &ndash; Essence 3), or 2. Due to the jostling of the van as they escape, the gamemaster de- cides it’s enough stress to prevent Candyman from spend- ing Edge on the test. Rolling his 9 dice, Candyman gets 4 hits. That’s 2 over the threshold, healing 1 box of Overflow. With so little success, Candyman waits to take out the medkit and apply it until they’ve gotten to a smoother stretch of road. He has an hour, so that’s fine. For the time being, he connects all the leads and gets the medkit ready. When the time comes, the road is smoother, and Candy- man gets to make another Biotech 5 + Logic 4 test with a threshold of 2, this time choosing to use a 4-Edge Boost to add his Edge attribute of 5 to his roll. He rolls his 14 dice and gets 6 hits thanks to those exploding 6s. That is 4 over the threshold, allowing him to heal that last Overflow with 1 hit, 2 boxes of Physical with 2 hits, and a box of Stun with the other 1. The efforts rouse Carson from his forced nap, though he is not happy due to the massive amount of pain he is in thanks to all those wounds. Hopefully, the medkit is</p>
<p class="calibre1">pumping out the good stuff to ease his pain. Candyman slides out of the way and lets Cottonmouth take over. To cast his Heal spell, Cottonmouth rolls Sorcery 6 + Magic 6 with a threshold of 2 (5 &ndash; Essence 3, same as be- fore). Since Candyman got Carson out of the danger zone, Cottonmouth’s not going to toss Edge into her spell, but she manages 5 hits on her 12 dice. This leaves her 3 hits over the threshold for healing, which she uses to heal another two boxes of Physical (2 hits) and one of Stun (1 hit). Carson is still sitting with 8 boxes of Stun and 7 boxes of Physical damage. For those injuries, he’s now on his own with natural recovery, though thanks to a favor, he can get a little medical assistance from his street doc for two days. The drive over to the street doc takes two hours, during which Carson rests and takes two tests to recover Stun damage, rolling Body + Willpower. He gets 3 hits on the first roll and 4 on the second. He’s down to just a single box of Stun when he reaches the street doc, but he’s still pretty beat up, physically. Within the first hour at the clinic, Carson manages to wipe out that last box of Stun with natural healing, thanks to the +2 bonus he gets from the clinic staff. After the first day Carson makes his first Body + Body + 2 roll and gets 4 hits, dropping those 7 boxes down to 3. On day two, he makes another test with the bonus and gets 3 hits. He’s as good as new! Not bad after a run that had gone so far sideways.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Make a Biotech + Logic test against a thresh- old of 5 &ndash; target’s Essence. If the target is one-hundred-percent natural, the healer actually gets an automatic hit added to what they roll. Again, like First Aid, this fixes biological ma- terial, not machinery. Hits above the necessary threshold can be used to heal one box of Stun, Physical, or Overflow Damage per hit, but not damage from drain. There is a limit to receiving a medkit treatment. A character can only benefit from a medkit once for any single set of injuries.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic Sorcery + Magic (using Healing or similar spell) The wonders of magic are many and great. Healing spells are some of the most commonly studied magics for those working on the streets. Some use their skills to earn a little extra cash patching up gangers; others serve on a runner team, keeping their partners fighting when the bullets start finding their targets. Those with hearts of gold work as regular street healers to give the denizens of the barrens a chance at a healthy life. The good news about magical healing is it</p>
<p class="calibre1">works at the speed of a spell&mdash;once the spell is cast, the effect takes hold. Healing magic can mend both Physical and Stun injuries, but not those caused by Drain. The left- over taint of wearisome mana prevents the healing magics from connecting to that damaged tissue to heal it. As with medkits, net hits can be used to heal one box of Stun, Physical, or Overflow Dam- age per hit. For more information on casting heal- ing spells, see p.&nbsp;135. A character can be healed by Magic only once for any single set of injuries.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Natural Recovery/ Medical Assistance (Varies by damage type) After all other options have been used, if injury remains, it’s all about rest and possibly some help from a trained medical professional (or just your team medic). Rest is simply defined as not engaging in any strenuous physical or mental activity&mdash;es- sentially, anything that involves a dice roll would break your rest. Medical attention offers a bonus to the recovery roll. If any person trained in Biotech is watching over the character for at least half of their rest period, the wounded individual gains a +2 dice pool modifier to the healing tests defined below.</p>
<p class="calibre1">COMBAT // HEALING</p>
<p class="calibre1">Natural recovery occurs at two separate rates&mdash; one for Stun Damage, and another for Physical Dam- age. Wound modifiers do not apply to these tests. To heal Stun Damage, roll Body + Willpower once per hour. Each hit heals a box of Stun Dam- age after that hour of rest. To heal Physical Damage, roll Body + Body once per day. Each hit heals a box of Physical Damage after that day of rest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Overflow Body + Body - Wound Modifiers Sometimes a hit brings you closer to death than you ever really want to be, and you’ve got some Damage Overflow boxes to recover. These boxes are healed just like Physical Damage and need to be healed before the character can return to the land of the conscious. Note that if a character re- ceives (Body x 2) boxes of Overflow damage, they are dead and gone, beyond the reach of any kind of healing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Toxins and Drugs It’s not just hot lead and wild mana that are out to hurt or help you in the Sixth World. Sometimes the enemy is chemical in nature, and those mole- cules can frag you up just as bad as a steel jack- et to the cranium or boost you up with that edge you could never afford to get installed. Toxins and drugs come in a stunning array of forms in Shad- owrun; the former are usually weaponized; the lat- ter, mostly recreational or enhancing. This section will deal with the highs and lows, but we’re leaving the ways to get addicted to these substances out of these core rules. You can pick it up as a quality, but the rules for gaining an addiction through use will be covered in a future book. Toxin and drug costs are on p.&nbsp;312. Toxins and drugs have similar attributes to identify how to use the substances in the game.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vector Vector refers to how the toxin is delivered to the target. Contact toxins can be solid, liquid, or gaseous. They attack the victim through the skin. These toxins, if in liquid form, can be coated on a melee weapon. In this case, they can be applied with a successful melee attack, whether the attack caus- es damage or not. A chemical seal (p.&nbsp;266) offers complete protection from this vector, unless it’s breached. Ingestion toxins must be eaten by the victim. They can be solids or liquids. Since they must be eaten, they generally take longer to have an effect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Inhalation toxins are applied as an aerosol spray or gas, and they must be breathed in by the target. Gas masks, chemical seals, and active inter- nal air tanks provide immunity to inhalation tox- ins; targets can also hold their breath for Body x 10 combat rounds. Injection toxins must get into the target’s bloodstream, whether through a dart, hypodermic needle, or a cut. These can also be used to coat an edged melee weapon, but they only affect a target hit with a successful melee attack that causes Phys- ical damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Speed Speed determines how quickly the victim suffers the toxin’s effects. These effects are always applied at the end of a combat round. Immediate means the Effect is applied at the end of the same combat round in which the victim is exposed. A Speed of 1 combat round means the Effect is applied at the end of the next combat round, and so on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Duration Duration offers the length the substance stays effective in the bloodstream for the purposes of Concentration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Power Power tells how powerful the toxin is. For tox- ins that do actual damage, either Physical or Stun, Power serves as the DV of the attack. A Toxin Re- sistance test (Body + Willpower + the rating of any appropriate protective gear/systems) is used to re- duce the damage. If a substance’s Power is reduced to 0, then no damage occurs, and no other effects happen, unless noted in the substance description. Some toxins don’t inflict actual damage, but Power is still used to determine if other effects take place. If the Toxin Resistance test reduces the Power to 0, then no effects take place, unless noted in the substance description.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Effect Effect tells what happens to a victim exposed to the toxin. Many toxins simply cause damage; in this case, the effect supplies the type of damage. Damage from toxins is treated just like any other injury. Some toxins cause other effects, such as im- posing a particular status (p.&nbsp;51) on the character. These statuses are listed as part of the substance’s description. Unless otherwise noted, all effects oc- cur unless the toxin’s Power is reduced to 0 in a Toxin Resistance test. If a toxin is resisted fully, the imposed statuses do not apply unless noted in the toxin description.</p>

<p class="calibre1">TOXINS AND DRUGS // COMBAT</p>
<p class="calibre1">122</p>
<p class="calibre1">Concentration Sometimes a character gets hit with a lot of a toxin. If exposed to more than a single dose at a giv- en time, increase the Power of the toxin by +1 per additional dose. Likewise, if an individual is left in contact with a toxin for an extended period, the ef- fects can be increased. If the victim is still being ex- posed to the toxin after 10 combat rounds, perform another Toxin Resistance test, and so on each time another 10 combat rounds passes. For each subse- quent Toxin Resistance test after the first, increase the Power of the toxin by +1, cumulatively.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Antidotes If they’re to do any good, antidotes must be tak- en before a toxin’s effects kick in. An antidote tak- en afterward will not diminish the damage caused by the toxin but may reduce the Duration and the toxin’s other effects. Note that some toxins simply have no effective antidote, particularly neurotox- ins. If a victim has suffered Overflow damage from a toxin, then application of the appropriate anti- dote prevents any ongoing damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Toxins “Toxins” is a catchall term for many substanc- es, including knockout drugs, nerve agents, truth serums, and more. If you’re going to use it as a weapon, rather than a boost or recreational high, it falls in this category. The following are just a few of the chemical weapons that shadowrunners might encounter, either offensively or defensively. Gamemasters should note that wind and other en- vironmental conditions may disperse gaseous tox- ins when used outdoors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">CS/Tear Gas • Vector: Contact, Inhalation • Speed: 1 combat round • Duration: (6 &ndash; Body) x 5 minutes, minimum 5 minutes • Power: 8 • Effect: Dazed status, Nauseated status, Stun Damage CS gas is an irritant that affects the eyes, skin, and mucus membranes, causing them to burn and water. It also stimulates a physiological panic re- sponse: increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and so forth. Washing thoroughly with soap and water can remove CS from the victim’s skin, thus ending the duration of the nausea prematurely. CS gas becomes inert after two minutes of contact with the air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gamma-Scopolamine • Vector: Injection • Speed: Immediate • Duration: (6 &ndash; Body) x 30 minutes, minimum 30 minutes • Power: 12 • Effect: Dazed status, Immobilized status, truth serum (see description) This particularly nasty agent, derived from nightshade, is a neuromuscular blocking agent that paralyzes its target. It takes effect immediate- ly, causing dizziness, pupil dilation, speech loss, delirium, and paralysis. The full effects last for about an hour. Once the primary effects wear off, the remaining residue in the victim’s system acts as a “truth serum” for another hour. Reduce the target’s Willpower by 3 (to a minimum of 1) for the remainder of the toxin’s duration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Narcoject • Vector: Injection • Speed: Immediate • Duration: (6 &ndash; Body) hours, minimum 1 hour • Power: 15 • Effect: Stun Damage A common tranquilizer, narcoject is typically used with dart guns. It has no side effects.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nausea Gas • Vector: Inhalation • Speed: 3 combat rounds • Duration: (6 &ndash; Body) minutes, minimum 1 minute • Power: 9 • Effect: Dazed status, Nauseated status Used as a riot control agent, this gas causes nausea and a crippling need to vomit. Nausea gas becomes inert after two minutes of contact with the air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Neuro-Stun (VIII, IX, X) • Vector: Contact, Inhalation • Speed: 1 combat round • Duration: (6 &ndash; Body) x 10 minutes, mini- mum 10 minutes • Power: VIII 9; IX 12; X 15 • Effect: Dazed status, Stun Damage Neuro-Stun is colorless and odorless. It’s the industry standard knockout gas for emergency</p>
<p class="calibre1">COMBAT // TOXINS AND DRUGS</p>
<p class="calibre1">123</p>
<p class="calibre1">containment situations and comes in various con- centrations. Neuro-Stun VIII becomes completely inert after ten minutes of contact with air; Neu- ro-Stun IX and X become completely inert after one minute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pepper Punch • Vector: Contact, Inhalation • Speed: 1 combat round • Duration: (8 &ndash; Body) x 20 minutes, mini- mum 20 minutes • Power: 11 • Effect: Blinded I status, Dazed status, Nause- ated status, Stun Damage Pepper punch is an irritant combining CS and capsaicin, which is derived from the active ingredi- ent in hot peppers, along with other chemicals. It is typically deployed as a liquid spray for personal defense and deterrence; this agent is often tagged with RFID tags or special dyes to identify victims later. Someone dosed with pepper punch feels an intense burning on any affected skin; this affect is even more pronounced if it gets in the eyes, nose, or mouth. Victims sprayed in the eyes have trouble seeing, and breathing becomes difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Seven-7 • Vector: Contact, Inhalation • Speed: 1 combat round • Duration: (6 &ndash; Body) x 10 minutes, mini- mum 10 minutes • Power: 12 • Effect: Blinded I status, Physical Damage, Dazed status, Nauseated status This is another colorless and odorless gas, de- veloped specifically to bypass chemical protection measures. In addition to Physical damage, Seven-7 causes cramping, nausea, and double vision in vic- tims. Seven-7 oxidizes and becomes inert after ten minutes of exposure to air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Drugs Drugs are toxins that you take on purpose, and they run the gamut from beer to high-intensity performance and mood enhancers. They can have enormous effects on a character’s mood and per- sonality. If a character gets high on street drugs, it shouldn’t be glossed over; roleplaying is encour- aged. People on these drugs usually display dra- matic changes in their behavior. Depending on the drug, they can become deliriously happy or cata- strophically depressed. They can become sexually</p>
<p class="calibre1">TOXINS AND DRUGS // COMBAT</p>
<p class="calibre1">124</p>
<p class="calibre1">aroused, with or without an accompanying loss of inhibitions. They might become paranoid and en- ter a homicidal rage. Drugs have the same charac- teristics as toxins.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alcohol • Vector: Ingestion • Speed: 1 minute • Duration: (8 &ndash; Body) hours, minimum 1 hour • Power: 6 • Effect: &ndash;1 Reaction, &ndash;1 Logic, High Pain Tol- erance (p.&nbsp;72) Ranging from wine and beer to pure grain al- cohol and mixed up in a variety of ways to taste good going down, alcohol is used across the world, though these days it’s usually synthahol, a synthet- ic alcohol used because fermentation and process- ing take nuyen.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bliss • Vector: Inhalation, Injection • Speed: 1 combat round • Duration: (6 &ndash; Body) hours, minimum 1 hour • Power: 8 • Effect: &ndash;1 Reaction, &ndash;1 Willpower, High Pain Tolerance (p.&nbsp;72) A tranquilizing narcotic, bliss is an opiate syn- thesized from poppy plants. It takes its name from the sensations its users feel. Players attempting to roleplay a bliss user may want to focus on the es- capist angle, using the drug to block out the chaot- ic or unsatisfying world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cram • Vector: Ingestion, Inhalation • Speed: 10 minutes • Duration: (12 &ndash; Body) hours, minimum 1 hour • Power: 8 • Effect: +1 Reaction, +1D6 Initiative Dice Cram is an extremely popular stimulant. When this drug wears off, users crash and suffer 6 Stun damage (unresisted). Cram users appear hyper-alert, almost to the point of paranoia. They react quickly, often without thought, and they’re prone to irrational outbursts. Other common side effects are jitteriness and fidgeting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Deepweed • Vector: Ingestion, Inhalation • Speed: Immediate • Duration: (6 &ndash; Body) hours, minimum 1 hour • Power: 7 • Effects: +1 Willpower, forces Awakened characters to astrally perceive Deepweed is a narcotic derived by Caribbean houngans from an Awakened form of kelp. It’s ex- tremely enticing to the Awakened and is sometimes used to dose targets for possession. Deepweed forces any magically active user to astrally perceive, even if the user is an adept without the astral perception ability. Once its effects have worn off, deepweed us- ers suffer a &ndash;1 to all dice pools for the same dura- tion as the initial effect. There are dangers inherent in forced astral perception, such as attracting un- wanted attention. Role-playing the effects of deep- weed may mean portraying someone who seems not completely “present,” since they aren’t.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jazz • Vector: Inhalation • Speed: Immediate • Duration: 10 x 1D6 minutes • Power: 9 • Effect: +1 Reaction, +2D6 Initiative Dice Jazz is a stimulant designed to better the odds for run-of-the-mill law-enforcement officers who run up against augmented street samurai. It’s usu- ally taken from a single-dose inhaler (or “popper”). When jazz wears off, the user crashes and is flood- ed with despondent and miserable emotions, gain- ing the Dazed status (p.&nbsp;52) for a duration equal to the duration of the initial effect. Jazz makes people as jumpy and hyper as caffeinated two-year-olds. Role-playing a jazz user means turning it up a notch, portraying someone with too much energy to burn&mdash;and too much energy to focus.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kamikaze • Vector: Inhalation • Speed: Immediate • Duration: 10 x 1D6 minutes • Power: 10 • Effect: +1 Body, +1 Agility, +2 Strength, +1 Willpower, +2D6 Initiative Dice, High Pain Tolerance (p.&nbsp;72) Kamikaze is a tailored combat stimulant. When kamikaze wears off, the user crashes and suffers &ndash;1 Reaction, &ndash;1 Willpower, and the Fatigued II status for twice the duration of the drug’s Effect. They also suffer 6 Stun damage (unresisted).</p>
<p class="calibre1">COMBAT // TOXINS AND DRUGS</p>
<p class="calibre1">The repeated use of kamikaze has a destructive effect on the user’s metabolism. Large doses can cause excitement, tremors, momentary euphoria, and dilated pupils. Excess doses (bordering on overdose level) cause anxiety, hallucinations, and uncontrolled muscular movements. Even higher dosages lead to death. Kamikaze users are near- crazed, filled with a feeling of imperviousness and invincibility, exhibiting almost no regard for their own well-being. They can be entertaining to watch, as long as you’re not in front of them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Long Haul • Vector: Injection • Speed: 10 minutes • Duration: 4 days • Power: 11 • Effect: Alleviates need for sleep A combination of synthesized hormones and other brain-regulating chemicals, long haul stimulates the brain and keeps the user awake, obviating the need for sleep. A character dosed on long haul can remain awake for four days&mdash; without incurring any modifiers from fatigue or weariness. After this time, however, the user im- mediately passes out and sleeps soundly for 8D6 hours. If the character is kept awake during this period, they suffer from the Fatigued I status (p.&nbsp;52), as they are afflicted with hallucinations and an inability to concentrate. If a second dose of long haul is taken after the first has worn off, the character can stay awake an additional (1D6 / 2) days but suffers the Fatigued I status. A third dose offers a single day of wakefulness while dealing with the Fatigued II status. A fourth offers one more day with the Fatigued III status. After that, additional doses will have no effect, and the user suffers 12 Stun damage (unresisted) and must crash as detailed above. Long haul cannot keep a character awake past this point, no matter how many additional doses are administered. If forced awake with a stim patch, the Fatigued III state persists until the 8D6 hours of rest (more like a coma, really) have been taken.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nitro • Vector: Inhalation • Speed: 1 combat round • Duration: 10 x 1D6 minutes • Power: 12 • Effect: +2 Strength, +2 Willpower, +2 Per- ception, +1D6 Initiative Dice, High Pain Tol- erance (p.&nbsp;72)</p>
<p class="calibre1">A dangerous combination of potent drugs fa- vored by troll gangers, nitro is a powerful stimulant that can easily kill a user. After the drug’s effects wear off, the subject takes 9 Stun damage (unre- sisted) and suffers &ndash;2 to all tests (including Damage Resistance) for an equal duration. Nitro users feel infused with energy, suffer a diminished attention span, and talk incessantly (including to themselves).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Novacoke • Vector: Inhalation, Injection • Speed: 1 combat round • Duration: (10 &ndash; Body) hours, minimum of 1 hour • Power: 12 • Effect: +1 Reaction, +1 Charisma, +1 Per- ception, High Pain Tolerance (p.&nbsp;72) A stimulant derived from coca plants, novacoke is a highly addictive social drug. After the drug wears off, Charisma and Willpower are both re- duced to 0 for a duration equal to the duration of the initial effect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psyche • Vector: Ingestion • Speed: 10 minutes • Duration: (12&mdash;Body) hours, minimum of 1 hour • Power: 8 • Effect: +1 Intuition, +1 Logic This designer stimulant is especially prized by magicians and technomancers alike. In addition to the effects noted above, Awakened and Emerged users also only suffer a &ndash;1 dice pool modifier for each sustained spell or complex form (rather than the standard &ndash;2). Psyche users are simultaneously hyper-aware and detached, easily absorbed by de- tail and obsessive about certain facts or problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zen • Vector: Inhalation • Speed: 5 minutes • Duration: 10 x 1D6 minutes • Power: 7 • Effect: &ndash;2 Reaction, +1 Willpower, &ndash;1 dice to actions based on Physical attributes A psychedelic hallucinogen, zen is popular among those looking to escape reality or seeking trance-like states. It won’t help you much when you’re on a run, unless you dose your opponents with it.</p>

<p class="calibre1">TOXINS AND DRUGS // COMBAT</p>
<p class="calibre1">Slinging Mojo for Fun and Profit If you’re a mage, you’re rare. Powerful. Desired. Hunted. You can do things no one else can do, but you may not fully know how to control your power. You have abilities other people dream about, but compared to what the most powerful people in the world wield, it’s a pittance. It is enough to make you a target, but it may not be enough to save you. Unless you can make it enough. The science of magic can be&mdash;and has been&mdash;dis- cussed endlessly in the halls of august institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Thaumaturgy, but only a few Awakened in- dividuals learn about it that way. More of them, especially shadowrunners, learn by trial and error, by getting into scrapes and seeing if their powers can get them out of it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The alleys of the Sixth World are littered with the corpses of those who didn’t learn fast enough. Mana can be channeled in a number of dif- ferent ways, and the students of magic&mdash;whether they learn in university labs or on the streets&mdash;are regularly coming up with new ways to use it. The boundaries between the different schools and cat- egories are not always clear, and understanding why an individual can do some things with mana but not others has driven more than one thauma- turgical professor quite mad. Still, despite the un- certainties and blurred lines, the metahuman mind craves organization, so here are the most common ways mana is used by the Awakened. Spells: The classic. The first thing you think about when you think about magic. You wave your hands, you say a phrase, and hey presto, something impossible happens. Though in the Sixth World, you don’t need gestures, you don’t need words, you don’t need magical ingredients&mdash;you just need the will, the knowledge, and the ability to make it</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC // SLINGING MOJO FOR FUN AND PROFIT</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen. Though many a spellslinger becomes en- amored of the dramatic word or gesture, because who doesn’t like lightning darting out from their pointing finger, or opening your mouth to sud- denly spew a stream of acid? And if you’ve met enough spellslingers, then you should be well ac- quainted with their flair for the dramatic. Astral Reality: One thing some&mdash;but not all&mdash; spellslingers figured out after the Awakening was that you could do more than use mana. If you at- tuned yourself properly, you could see it, wisps and tendrils of mana drifting through the world. Of course, if you did so, the rest of the world faded mostly from view, but now more than ever, life is about trade-offs. The type of experts who get to name things were quick to name this phase of existence the astral plane, since it closely re- sembled a long-hypothesized realm. Learning how to gain information by carefully studying this plane, and finding out how to project your full consciousness into the astral, became crucial magical skills. Conjuring: Sixth World discoveries, almost inevitably, come with a twist or three. First they found out mana existed, then they found out it could be perceived with a slight shift of your sens- es, and then they discovered that metahumans weren’t the only beings who traveled there. The world&mdash;or more properly, the metaverse&mdash;is full of beings that capture the essence of certain elements of our reality. Our world is full of animals, so there are wild creatures that have been dubbed spirits of beasts. There are creatures that channel the an- cient key elements, so they now are called spirits of air, water, fire, and earth. Then there are spirits that adopt metahuman appearances and demean- ors, because argle bargle, foofaraw, hey diddy hoe diddy no one knows. What’s more, these spirits often have their own home planes, making a vast metaverse that somehow makes the infinite physi- cal universe in which people live seem tiny. A lot of information about these metaplanes has been collected, but the first thing Awakened people need to know about them is simple: They are full of spirits that can be summoned and con- trolled. These spirits have become incredibly useful for many shadowrunners, and incredibly danger- ous for those who face them. The corps, of course, have jumped on to the astral security bandwagon, meaning any decent facility will have spirits wait- ing in hiding to make your life difficult. Or short. Enchanting: This area of magic has been chased by humanity for perhaps longer than any other. In ancient Greece, Perseus carried a magic sword and shield, and Ajax and Achilles carried magic shields in the Trojan War. In Sumerian mythology, Marduk raised Imhullu, the wind weapon, against Tiamat during the creation of the world. And you have protective amulets, warding glyphs, mojo bags, lucky stones, nazars to protect from the evil</p>
<p class="calibre1">eye, and more. These days, we have telesma, foci, and spell preparations to hold magic and some- times unleash it at opportune moments. Adept powers: For some Awakened, magic doesn’t flow through spells or spirits. It pours into their body and twists around their muscles, their nerves, their bones, or whatever, enhancing their abilities beyond normal human ranges. They may gain strength, speed, smarts, or even charm. They may enhance their senses even beyond what the rest of us do with cyber. They are superhuman, which means they are everything we have dreamed about&mdash;and everything we fear. That’s what magic does. How? That’s what the rest of the chapter is about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic Basics Skills The primary skills the Awakened need are Sor- cery, Conjuring, and Enchanting, with Astral also having use on the astral plane, from reading au- ras to fighting astral beings. The main three magi- cal skills are all connected to the Magic attribute, while Astral is connected to Intuition. A high num- ber of magical actions are aimed at other charac- ters or beings in some way, which means most tests are Opposed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Drain Magic is tiring. The more you attempt to do with it, the more it’s going to take out of you. This is reflected through the concept of Drain, which presents damage an Awakened character must re- sist after channeling their magic. By default, Drain is Stun Damage, though certain conditions can make it Physical. These conditions are described in the sections on Spellcasting, Conjuring, Adepts, and Enchanting. Many Awakened individuals train themselves to endure the weariness that comes from casting spells, and they often get better at it as time goes by. The dice rolls used to resist drain vary based on the Awakened individual’s tradition. Those charac- ters roll their tradition Attribute + Willpower, and drain damage is reduced by 1 for each hit rolled, to a minimum of 0. Damage from drain cannot be healed by most other non-rest means, meaning no magic, no medkits. Edge, though, can be used to heal drain damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Traditions Magic in the Sixth World is highly individu- al.&nbsp;Each adept, spellcaster, conjurer, mage, and whatever learns how to make the mana flow, and they find individual ways to hone their mental focus to help them be as effective as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">127</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC BASICS // MAGIC</p>
<p class="calibre1">128</p>
<p class="calibre1">This means that while words and gestures are not needed to work with magic, some people may use them anyway, because it helps them achieve the necessary focus. People also respond to magic through the pre- conceptions and worldviews they bring with them. This is natural&mdash;every person in the world con- stantly filters input through their own lived experi- ences and belief structure, giving themselves some sort of framework to deal with the world. Many things influence this filter, including the culture in which people are raised, or cultures they encounter at some point in life that speak to them and help them make sense of the world. In the realm of magic, these filters are usual- ly referred to as traditions. A tradition is critical to Awakened individuals learning how to channel and interact with mana. If you see the world in a religious tradition, you might integrate magic into this worldview, looking at how magic does or does not reflect the will of God. If you come from a strong, longstanding, distinct culture&mdash;like, say, the Igbo of Nigeria, or the Sioux of North Amer- ica&mdash;you might have a wealth of stories and lore that tell you how magic fits into the world, so you continue to use that framework as you see what magic can do. The Sixth World hosts a wide variety of cultures and beliefs, which means it also has a wide variety of traditions. This rulebook covers two of them, which in some ways can be seen as overarching traditions that reflect two of the pre-eminent ways of understanding magic&mdash;the hermetic tradition and the shamanic tradition. There are other tra- ditions, many of them, and they all play a role in how Awakened people interact with mana. Each tradition includes a Tradition Attribute that is used in a number of circumstances, from resisting drain to determining astral Attack Rating.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermeticism Tradition Attribute: Logic The interpretations of hermeticism have varied somewhat over the centuries, but Sixth World her- metic beliefs are centered on a single key point: That while magic is not yet fully understood, it is understandable. Hermeticists take a scientific ap- proach to magic, rigorously staging trial after trial, lab test after lab test to build a better understand- ing of the underpinnings of logic. It should not be surprising that the faculties of the most prominent thaumaturgical universities in the world are heavi- ly staffed by hermetic mages. Hermeticists see themselves as part of a long, proud tradition of striving to understand the laws undergirding the world and manipulate them. They are more than happy to point out that Isaac Newton’s alchemical studies took up more of his time than his work on physics, and that people like</p>
<p class="calibre1">John Dee and Aleister Crowley, who were pushed to the margins of academia, had their reputations dramatically upgraded after the Awakening. Since hermeticists feel they understand magic, they think that puts them ahead of any other branch of aca- demia, since others’ understanding is rooted in this world only. This strongly contributes to their rep- utation for snobbery and arrogance, a reputation they tend to embrace through the concept that it’s not arrogance if you can back it up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shamanism Tradition Attribute: Charisma Shamanism has a point it would like to make with regard to hermeticism, and that point is often made with the middle finger. Shamanistic practi- tioners find hermeticists’ desires to fit everything into some sort of cold, calculated order alternate- ly amusing and infuriating. They slightly adapt an old saying when they claim that writing about magic is like dancing about architecture. Magic is meant to be felt and experienced, not studied in austere labs and boring classrooms. They point out that the very concept of different traditions shows that there is an individualistic bent to magic, and they say the cold equations of hermeticism cannot account for the variety and power they see in dif- ferent magic expressions. Followers of the shamanic tradition believe magic is to be experienced and performed, not put under glass. If that occasionally leads to inconsis- tent results or accidental injury, well, that’s what happens in art, in love, and in so many other parts of life, so why should magic be any different? Hermeticists tend to see shamans as sloppy and undisciplined, and that’s exactly the way shamans like it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Recognizing Magic On some occasions, magic desperately wants to be noticed. The flashy fireball, the showy bolt of lightning&mdash;the mage throwing them wants them to hurt, yeah, but they also want them to be scary and intimidating. But that’s only some of the time. Much of the time, magic functions best when it is difficult to see. The illusion that provides mis- direction, the invisibility spell that conceals, the subtle mana spell that whomps opponents along- side their head before they see anything coming. These require subtlety. So how do you know when magic is acting on you&mdash;and perhaps more impor- tantly, how do you recognize when it’s about to be thrown at you? Your first and best defense when it comes to no- ticing magic is other Awakened people. The spell that is hidden in the physical world tends to light up the astral like an oil lantern, or a commlink on its brightest setting, or whatever other light source</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC // MAGIC BASICS</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’d like to imagine. A teammate who can see the astral is a considerable advantage in the sens- ing-magic department. They are not, however, a guarantee. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, so for every method of discovering information, there is a strategy to hide it. Not having a strategy to see the astral is foolish; relying on that as the only way to perceive magic is dangerous. So what else should you look for to know that magic has been unleashed? Here are some hints: Learn how the world works and how it doesn’t: The best way to spot something unnatural is to un- derstand what is natural, to better recognize what should not be. The Sixth World is, of course, an immensely complicated and tricky place, where the course of the world operating in its normal way can seem surprising and uncanny. Careful observation, though, will tell you when something is off. Did a flight of pixies throwing trails of glitter just sweep into a nightclub? That’s just the way the world is.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One primary effect is that Awakened charac- ters avoid cyberware, bioware, and other implants. These things reduce their Essence, which in turn limits some of their mana-channeling abilities. Which is something few Awakened people want. The other main effect is that the more technol- ogy and artifice there is in an object, the harder it is for it to be affected by magic. This is measured in what’s called Object Resistance, and it often fig- ures in to how well spells cast on items succeed. The Object Resistance table provides guidelines for this rating.</p>

<p class="calibre1">dai hasn’t built a centaur-modded version of that model yet. Careful observation always helps. Find the center: One of the critical aspects of Sixth World magic is that the vast majority of spells require the caster to see their targets. So if you see a bunch of weirdness going on and you’re not entirely sure if it’s magical in nature or not, look for the center of the action. Then see if there is someone near the center who keeps scanning the area to make sure they see all the areas they need to. If you do, what you’re seeing is probably magic, and the person in the center is probably the caster. Remember that gestures happen: Are gestures needed to make magic happen? No.&nbsp;Do people still do them? You bet your hoop. Watch out for the twitchy fingers. If you see them, you may have found a caster.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Game Information Noticing magic requires a Perception + Intu- ition Test; the threshold is the Magic rank of the person who cast the spell. Note that this only ap- plies to noticing magic in the regular world; no- ticing magic in the astral plane is easier, but also a whole other ball game that will be covered later.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic, Technology, and Resistance Magic and technology have never gotten along well. Why? Go ask an MIT&amp;T professor when you have a couple hours to kill&mdash;you’ll learn more about the nature of mana than you ever wanted to know. Whether you understand the reasons or not, the divide exists, and it plays a strong role in shaping how the Awakened function.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Magical Lodges Some Wicca practitioners have a magic circle, the Pueblo use kivas, and hermetic mages have their libraries. All of these can serve as magical lodges, places where the Awakened can concen- trate their power and focus their energies for a va- riety of magical tasks. A magical lodge is a room-sized space that is dedicated to the practice of magic, and it reflects the tradition of the user. Its walls are covered with things that go beyond mere decorations&mdash;they are items of meaning and focus, helping the mental and magical energies of the owner. Magical lodges provide space for the follow- ing uses: • Learning spells (p.&nbsp;130) • Serving as a mana barrier (p.&nbsp;161)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The amount of power the lodge can provide in those functions&mdash;and, incidentally, the cost of the lodge&mdash;is measured as the Force of the lodge. Characters can make a temporary lodge with reagents (see p.&nbsp;153), or they can make a permanent one. To do that, you need magical lodge materials (they cost Force x 500 nuyen) that are appropriate to your tradition. Once you have the materials, find a space to put it, like your apartment, or a cave in the wilder- ness, or a secret abandoned sewer tunnel&mdash; someplace you won’t mind spending some time,</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC BASICS // MAGIC</p>
<p class="calibre1">130</p>
<p class="calibre1">and where you can be relatively safe and un- noticed. Then spend a number of days equal to the lodge’s Force dedicating the space, setting up the physical components, building its astral form, setting up barriers, and harmonizing it to your aura. Once you’re done, your magical lodge is up and active. An active magical lodge acts as a mana barrier (p.&nbsp;161) and shares your astral signature. A lodge is not built to be portable. If you want to move it, you’ll need a day to take it down, turn- ing it back into magical lodge materials; then you can set it up again somewhere else. If you want to improve your lodge, just bring in more materials to add to the current ones and then spend 1 day per point of Force you want the lodge to have at the end of your work (not just the increase or differ- ence between old Force and new Force).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spells When people think of magic, they tend to think of spells first. Spells are the process that makes magic happen, the channeling of magic into an effect that stops the world in its tracks&mdash; or keeps you from being noticed at all. This is how they work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Learning Spells New spells, rituals, or alchemical preparations can be learned by studying spell formulae or find- ing some mentor (either a spirit or another Awak- ened individual) to teach you. Some magicians may be lucky enough to have a library of collected scrolls and grimoires passed down from previous generations. They also could have an Awakened family member teach them a new spell. For the rest of the Awakened, there are online communities such as SpellSource and Magicknet that hold col- lections of formulae submitted from various tradi- tions. These networks are generally supported by one or more corporations, meaning that in order to use it, you’ll need have a legal SIN and a license to practice magic. Or good fakes. Established ma- gicians sometimes work in the grey area of teach- ing unlicensed magicians, picking up a little extra nuyen by passing on knowledge to someone not quite as experienced. If you want to learn alone, you can buy a spell formula (prices on the Magical Goods table, p.&nbsp;168). If you want a living, breathing teacher, they usually charge around (Influence skill x formula cost) nuyen&mdash;expensive, but usually worth every bit of the jing you spend. Either way, you’ll need a magical lodge of your own tradition (see p.&nbsp;127).</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC // SPELLS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once you have access to a magical lodge and ei- ther a formula or a teacher for the spell you want, you’re ready to try to learn the spell. Make a Learn- ing test, which is a (Sorcery or Enchanting, depend- ing on the type of formula) + Intuition test. The time you need to learn the spell is equal to twelve days divided by the number of hits you get. If you have a teacher, they can make an Instruction test (p.&nbsp;96) to add extra dice to your Learning test. At the end of the study time, spend 5 Karma to learn the formula for the spell, ritual, or alchemical preparation. All injury modifiers apply, as do distractions from sustaining spells, poor conditions, and so forth. If your formula or teacher is of a different tradition than you, you take a &ndash;4 penalty to the Learning test. While learning the spell, you must devote eight hours of each day to studying it, otherwise you fail and must start all over. If you get no hits on the Learning test, you fail. If you do end up failing, no Karma is spent, but any money you spent on instruction is gone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Casting Spells Casting a spell has three primary steps (note that Combat spells add a step before these three): 1. Adjust the spell; 2. Roll a Spellcasting test (Sorcery + Magic); and 3. Deal with drain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Adjust the spell Adjusting the spell isn’t always needed or even possible. The only adjustments that can be made are: Amp Up: This is for Combat spells only. For each point of base damage the caster wants to add to a Combat spell, increase the drain of that casting by 2. Increase Area: Area-effect spells have a base ef- fect of a sphere with a two-meter radius. For each increase of 2 meters in the radius of the area of effect, increase the drain of the casting by 1. Shift Area: This can only be done with certain area-effect spells. The caster can shift the area a sustained spell is affecting to another area within spell range. Spells that can have the area shifted are noted in the spell description. This requires a Minor Action and can be done any time. It does not cause drain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Roll the Spellcasting test The Spellcasting test is Sorcery + Magic; the number of hits needed and/or the opposed roll are described in the Spell Descriptions (p.&nbsp;131).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Deal with drain Each spell has a Drain Value, which may be increased by any adjustments the caster makes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The caster rolls Willpower + their tradition at- tribute&mdash;Logic for hermetic mages, Charisma for shamans&mdash;and compares the hits to the Drain Value of the cast spell. If the hits are equal to or greater than the Drain Value, the drain has no ef- fect. If the Drain Value is higher than the hits, the caster experiences Stun damage equal to the dif- ference between hits and Drain Value. If the dam- age after the resistance test is higher than the cast- er’s Magic, the damage becomes Physical. Drain damage cannot be healed by magic or medkits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spell Descriptions Shadowrun spells have the following ele- ments: Category: Spells in Shadowrun are divided into five categories: Combat, Detection, Health, Illusion, and Manipulation. Spells are listed ac- cording to their category, since there are com- monalities throughout the category. Range: This is either Touch, meaning the tar- get needs to be touched in order for the spell to take effect (when touching an unwilling target, make an unarmed Close Combat attack, and subtract the target’s Armor rating from their Defense Rating for this attack); LOS, meaning the caster needs a physical sight line to the tar- get (optical lenses such as binoculars count as physical line of sight; magical effects and digi- tized images such as thermographic goggles do not); LOS(A) means the spell has a line of sight range and also has an area effect, which starts at a two-meter-radius sphere; Special means the range is defined in the write-up of the spell. Duration: This describes how long the spell lasts. It is usually Instantaneous (I), meaning it takes effect and then immediately dissipates; Sustained (S), meaning the effect lasts as long as the caster keeps it in operation (dropping a sustained spell requires no use of an action; the magician simply stops holding it); Limited (L) means the spell has a set endpoint that the spell cannot be sustained beyond, but it can be dropped earlier than that if desired (the standard penalties for Sustained spells apply); and Perma- nent (P), meaning the effect does not dissipate and stays in place without any effort or focus on the part of the caster&mdash;the spell becomes a full part of the world. Type: This is either M (for mana) or P (for physical). Mana spells interact solely with the astral plane; they may affect living beings, as liv- ing beings have an astral component, but they have no effect on nonliving, non-astral entities. Physical spells only affect the physical realm. Drain Value (DV): This is the base value that casters must resist to avoid experiencing drain. It can be increased if casters use Amp Up or In- crease Area to adjust their spells.</p>

<p class="calibre1">SPELLS // MAGIC</p>
<p class="calibre1">132</p>
<p class="calibre1">sustained costs Magic is wearying and requires concentration, so if you are trying to keep a spell running while doing other things, there will be a price to pay due to the concentration and energy spent maintaining the spell. Whenever a spellcaster is sustaining a spell, they take a &ndash;2 dice pool penalty to any action test for each spell they sustain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indirect Spellcasting Cass Wandering Horse has played nice as long as he can, but negotiations have broken down, and it’s time to break out a fireball. Suckers gotta learn somehow. When it comes to Cass’ spot in initiative, he decides where the fireball is going to go. There are two securi- ty guards in one group, and two others close to each other with a third hanging not too far away. A two-me- ter-radius blast would get either group of two, but Cass figures he can hit a third if he adds an Increase Area effect, so he does. Since that adds one more to the Drain Value, he decides against increasing the damage on this spell. He doesn’t want a single fireball to wipe him out. With the targets selected, Cass first looks at his At- tack Rating. He’s a shaman with Magic 6 and Charisma 5, so his Attack Rating when casting spells is 11. The highest Defense Rating in the group he has targeted is 8; the difference is 3, so no Edge is awarded. Time to roll dice! Cass rolls Sorcery 5 + Magic 6, and those 11 dice give him a solid 5 hits. The gamemaster makes one roll for all three defenders, and they get 3 hits. Cass has hit all three. The base damage is Cass’ Magic divided by two, and a Fireball does Physical damage, so that’s 3P com- ing in on the guards. He got 2 net hits, so the damage is increased to 5P. The guards roll their Body rating, which is 3, and get 2 hits. That means they each take 3P damage. Fireball gives each damaged target the Burning sta- tus with a value equal to net hits, so the three guards get the Burning 2 status. If they don’t put the fires out, the status will do more damage. Now it’s time for Cass to pay the price of casting the Fireball. The base Drain Value is 6, and the Increase Area effect bumps it to 7. Cass has Charisma 5 and Will- power 5, so he rolls 10 dice. With only 3 hits, he is in position to take 4 Stun damage, and that feels painful to him. He spends 2 Edge to get a reroll, and it comes up a hit, bringing his total to 4, and the damage he has to take down to 3. That hurts, but the fire smoldering on his opponents will make them hurt worse.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These are characteristics of every spell; each category may add other characteristics, which are described under each category’s heading.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Combat Spells Simply put, Combat spells bring the pain. They’re what you cast to make enemies scared, un- conscious, or dead. Combat spells add a step after the first spellcast- ing step, something that should happen after targets have been selected. Once the targets are known, compare the Attack Rating and Defense Rating to see if either side gains Edge. In the case of multiple targets, use the highest Defense Rating to determine if Edge is awarded. A caster’s Attack Rating is Mag- ic + their tradition attribute; Defense Ratings are as normal, depending on if the defender is on the ma- terial plane or astral plane (see p.&nbsp;161). There are two essential kinds of Combat spells: Direct and Indirect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Direct Combat Spells Direct Combat spells are when you shape mana in a way that it directly pummels the opposition&mdash;the magic is the damage. When you cast a Direct Combat spell, roll Sorcery + Magic opposed by the Willpower + Intuition of the target. Net hits become damage and are added to any Amp Up damage the character chose. Damage from Direct Combat spells is not resisted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indirect Combat Spells Rather than having the magic do the pummeling, Indirect Combat spells create an effect that causes the damage&mdash;igniting a fireball, say, or sparking a lightning bolt. To cast an Indirect Combat spell, roll Sorcery + Magic vs.&nbsp;Reaction + Willpower. Damage is caster’s Magic divided by two (rounded up) + net hits + Amp Up damage. Targets roll their Body to resist this damage, as they would in physical com- bat. Indirect Combat spells frequently come with elemental effects (see p.&nbsp;109). In addition to normal spell characteristics, Combat spells list the type of damage done, wheth- er it is Stun (S) or Physical (P).</p>

<p class="calibre1">These spells shoot acid at targets, doing imme- diate damage while also doing Chemical damage (p.&nbsp;109) and giving hit targets the Corroded status (p.&nbsp;52) with a rating equal to net hits on the Spell- casting test. Acid Stream is a single-target spell, Toxic Wave is area effect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clout (Indirect Combat)</p>

<p class="calibre1">A classic. When you think of hurting people with magic, the first thing that comes to mind is making fire explode in their faces. These are the spells that’ll get that done. Flamestrike hits individuals, Fireball is area effect. Both spells do Fire elemental damage (p.&nbsp;110) and impose the Burning status (p.&nbsp;51) with a rating equal to net hits on the Spellcasting test.</p>

Ice Spear targets individuals, while Ice Storm is an area spell.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lightning Bolt (Indirect Combat)</p>

<p class="calibre1">Lightning Ball (Indirect Combat, Area)</p>

<p class="calibre1">It’s what deities from Zeus to Thor use to smite those who have it coming, which means it should be good enough for you, too. Lightning Bolt hits a single target with electricity, while Lightning Ball is area effect. Both spells do Electricity elemental damage (p.&nbsp;109), imposing the Zapped status (p.&nbsp;53) for a number of turns equal to net hits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manabolt (Direct Combat)</p>

<p class="calibre1">Detection Spells This category is all about heightening your sens- es, honing one element or another to be sharper, to cross long distances or pass through barriers, all in the interest of gaining information you would not otherwise have. For Detection spells, the Sorcery + Magic test is opposed by Body + Willpower when the targets are sentient, Object Resistance when they are not. The amount of information gained from Detec- tion spells is based on the Detection Spells Results table. Detection spells are typically cast on a subject that may be the caster (Range: Touch); the sensory enhancement often occurs in an area separate from the subject. Unlike many spells that require line of sight to the target, the area of sensory expansion can be separated from the subject by walls or bar- riers. The range for this area is the (Magic rating of the caster + Spellcasting test net hits) meters.</p>
<p class="calibre1">detection spells results table</p>
<p class="calibre1">1 General info without details Examples: Two life forms are present, it’s a medical device, some sort of spell is active 2 More information about form and function without specifics Examples: Both lifeforms are animals, it’s a tool for diagnostics, the spell is an Illusion spell 3 Specifics become more detailed Examples: The animals are dogs, the device develops an internal scan of possible injuries, the spell is Mass Confusion 4 Critical details are provided, including emotions and functions Examples: The dogs are angry and hungry, the device seems only partly functional, the spell was cast by a powerful caster.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Analyze Device</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch P S 2 Sure, you know what a commlink looks like, but that doesn’t mean you can identify the func- tion of the weird black box with a single input jack. And Ghost help you with a machine from the ’50s or something. Analyze Device provides infor- mation about the unknown device, based on the number of net hits (the device’s Object Resistance is used in the Opposed Test). The first time a char- acter tries to use a device while sustaining this spell on it, they receive Edge equal to their net hits on this test (though the customary limit of gaining no more than 2 Edge in a combat round applies).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Analyze Magic</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch P S 3 Sometimes you want to know what magic does without going astral. Treat this spell as if you are assensing (see p.&nbsp;159). The Opposed test uses 2 x total hits on the original skill test (Conjuring, En- chanting, or Sorcery) that created the magical ef- fect being analyzed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Analyze Truth</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch M S 3 The subject of the spell gains some sense if the target is telling the truth&mdash;or at least, if they be- lieve they are. With at least 1 net hit, you gain this understanding. Note that the subject of the spell has to directly hear the statement being uttered to evaluate it&mdash;written statements, recordings, or audio/video transmissions cannot be used. Because mana, that’s why.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clairaudience</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch M S 3 The person on whom this is cast gains the ability to hear distant sounds. The subject may select and move the spot; the size of the spot is determined by normal area-of-effect rules and can be adjust- ed with Increase Area and moved with Shift Area. The subject can only hear sounds in the target area while this spell is in effect (as opposed to sounds near them), and any hearing augmentations they have do not have any effect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clairvoyance</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch M S 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC // SPELLS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like Clairaudience, but with visuals instead of sound, so: The person on whom this is cast gains the ability to see distant sights. The subject may select and move the spot; the size of the spot is de- termined by normal area-of-effect rules and can be adjusted with Increase Area and can be moved with Shift Area. The subject can only see visuals in the target area while this spell is in effect (as opposed to sights near them), and any visual aug- mentations they have do not have any effect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Combat Sense</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch M S 3 The subject gets a heightened awareness of pos- sible dangers and the ability to react to them faster. Net hits on the Spellcasting test are added to the subject’s Defense Rating and dice pool for Surprise tests (see p.&nbsp;108) as long as the spell is sustained.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Detect Enemies</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch M S 3 This spell lets the subject know if anyone with- in the sense’s range has hostile intentions toward them. It only works on people&mdash;not things, and it only detects people who have hostility specifically to the subject, not generalized anger at all meta- humanity (if it did, everyone in the barrens would light up). Great for detecting ambushes!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Detect Life</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mindlink</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch M S 3 Commlinks and text messaging? So passé. Just throw your thoughts into someone else’s mind for the ultimate in rapid communication! As long as you get a hit on the Sorcery + Magic test, you have a link, and you can share mental communication in whatever form makes sense to you and subject of this spell. The caster and the subject must re- main within range of each other for the link to continue functioning; if they move out of sense range and then come back into it, they can pick up the communication again, as long as the spell was continuously sustained.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mind Probe</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch P S 5 The subject of this spell can dig into a target’s mind, seeing how many of their thoughts they can discern&mdash;while also attempting to sort what is true from the lies they tell themselves. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs.&nbsp;Willpower + Logic; net hits determine how much information the subject pulls out of the target’s head. The Mind Probe Results table shows the type of information this spell delivers.</p>

<p class="calibre1">target consciously knows and view the target’s recent memories (up to 72 hours). The subject can probe the target’s subconscious, gaining information the target may not even be consciously aware of, like psychological quirks, deep fears, or hidden memories.</p>
<p class="calibre1">living thing, but rather focuses on sentient beings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Detect Magic</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch M S 4 No one wants to sort through an entire landfill to find the magic ring sitting amid all the trash, but sometimes that’s the job. Which is why an en- terprising mage developed this spell, which alerts the caster to any forms of active magic within the sense’s range. This includes foci, reagents, active spells, wards, alchemical preparations, spirits, and active rituals, but does not include Awakened peo- ple, critters, astral signatures, alchemical prepara- tions that have been triggered or lost their potency, or the effects of permanent spells once they have become permanent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Health Spells These spells allow magic to flow from the hands of a spellcaster to the body of their target, mending damage or otherwise improving their health. Low Essence often makes healing more difficult, since magic and technology generally don’t mix, and the type of magic used to fix biological beings does lit- tle to metal, plastic, and electronics. The effects of Essence are noted in each spell description.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Antidote</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch P P 5 This spell sends mana coursing through the body to find and purge toxins. Roll a Sorcery + Magic (toxin power) Extended test. Each hit re-</p>

<p class="calibre1">136</p>
<p class="calibre1">duces the toxin power by one; once the power hits zero, any ongoing effects of the toxin are eliminated.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cleansing Heal</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch P P 5 This spell has the same healing effect as the Heal spell (roll Sorcery + Magic [5 &ndash; Essence], heal 1 box of Stun, Physical, or Overflow damage per net hit). In addition, this variant of the spell adds a cleansing element that eliminates the Corroded status on the targeted individual. Injuries can only be affected once by any healing spell.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cooling Heal</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch P P 5 This spell has the same healing effect as the Heal spell (roll Sorcery + Magic [5 &ndash; Essence], heal 1 box of Stun, Physical, or Overflow damage per net hit. In addition, this variant of the spell adds a cooling element that eliminates the Burning status on the targeted individual. Injuries can only be af- fected once by any healing spell.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Decrease Attribute</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch P S 3 The touch of the mage weakens, slows, or stu- pefies the target, temporarily lowering one of their attributes. The caster decides which attribute to target before casting the spell. The caster rolls a Sorcery + Magic vs.&nbsp;Willpower + targeted attri- bute. They can select how many net hits they actu- ally apply to the target at a rate of 1 point of de- crease per net hit; for each net hit applied beyond the first, the Drain Value of the spell increases by 1. The spell cannot affect Edge, Essence, Magic, or Resonance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Heal</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch P P 3 Shadowrunning comes with bumps, bruises, and bullet wounds, and magic is perhaps the quickest and most effective way to repair it. When casting this spell, roll Sorcery + Magic with a threshold of (5 &ndash; Essence). Heal 1 box of Stun, Physical, or Overflow damage per net hit. Injuries can only be affected once by any Heal spell (including Cleansing Heal, Cooling Heal, and Warming Heal).</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC // SPELLS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Increase Attribute</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch P S 3 The touch of the mage strengthens, speeds, or enlightens the target, temporarily raising one of their attributes. The caster decides which attribute to target before casting the spell. The caster rolls a Sorcery + Magic (5 &ndash; Essence) test. They can select how many net hits they actually apply to the tar- get to increase the selected attribute, at a rate of 1 point of increase per net hit (maximum bonus +4); for each net hit applied beyond the first, the Drain Value of the spell increases by 1. The spell cannot affect Edge, Essence, Magic, or Resonance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Increase Reflexes</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch P S 5 The reaction time and speed of the target in- crease, making them better able to anticipate and respond to others. The caster rolls a Sorcery + Magic (5 &ndash; Essence) test. They can select how many net hits they actually apply to the target to increase both their Reaction score and the number of Initiative Dice, at a rate of 1 point of increase and 1 Initiative Die per net hit; for each net hit ap- plied beyond the first, the Drain Value of the spell increases by 1.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Resist Pain</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch M S 3 While not providing healing, this spell allows the target to ignore the effects of damage, moving for- ward as if they did not have that pain. Roll Sorcery + Magic (5 &ndash; Essence); for each net hit, the target can reduce dice-pool modifiers from damage by 1.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stabilize</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch M P 3 This is the spell to use when someone is in Over- flow damage and is sustaining an ongoing damaging effect or status. Roll Sorcery + Magic, with a thresh- old of the number of Overflow boxes of damage the target has. Meeting the threshold means the target is stabilized , and all Overflow damage is removed. The net hits can only affect Overflow damage and cannot heal regular damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Warming Heal</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch P P 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">This spell has the same healing effect as the Heal spell (roll Sorcery + Magic [5 &ndash; Essence], heal 1 box of Stun, Physical, or Overflow dam- age per net hit). In addition, this variant of the spell adds a warming element that eliminates the Chilled status on the targeted individual. Injuries can only be affected once by any healing spell.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Illusion Spells Illusion spells are meant to convince people that the unreal is real, that something not there is there, or vice versa. They are cast with an Opposed test, where Sorcery + Magic is opposed by various com- binations of attributes, listed with each spell. Illusion spells of the Mana type affect living beings only; Physical Illusion spells affect cameras and other technology as well. Illusion spells might be Single Sense (meaning they affect only one sense) or Multi-Sense (mean- ing they affect multiple senses).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Agony (Single-Sense)</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS M S 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">This spell brings pain but not actual damage. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs.&nbsp;Willpower + Logic; each net hit acts like an additional box of damage in both the Physical and Stun Condition Monitors for the purposes of determining penalties due to injuries. If one or both Condition Monitors are completely filled, the targeted individual stays conscious but is so wracked with pain that they cannot act. Once the spell is dropped, there is no ongoing effect from the pain. The base spell affects only an individual, but the Increase Area effect can be applied to make it an area spell (starting at 2m radius for +1 DV).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confusion (Multi-Sense)</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS M S 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaos (Multi-Sense)</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS P S 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confusion hits the target with a swirl of imag- es and emotions that leave them disoriented and, well, confused. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs.&nbsp;Willpower + Logic; the target gains the Confused (#) status, with the number equaling the net hits on the test. The target experiences a dice pool penalty equal</p>

<p class="calibre1">SPELLS // MAGIC</p>
<p class="calibre1">138</p>
<p class="calibre1">to that number on all tests besides Damage Resis- tance tests. Chaos has the same effect, except it also affects cameras, microphones, and other forms of technology. The base spell affects only an individual, but the Increase Area effect can be applied to make it an area spell (starting with a 2m radius). When it is an area spell, the Shift Area effect can be used.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hush (Single-Sense)</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch M S 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence (Single-Sense)</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch P S 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence descends on that target, making them un- able to make a noise even if they tried. This can be great for people trying to sneak by a target, or a good way to throw disruption among people depending on vocal communication. Hush gives targets the Si- lent (#) status (see p.&nbsp;53), with the number equaling the net hits on the Sorcery + Magic test. That num- ber acts as a threshold for any attempts to hear the character. Silence acts the same, but it gives the Silent (Improved) (#) status, so that microphones and other technology also will not hear the targeted character.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Invisibility (Single-Sense)</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch M S 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">Improved Invisibility (Single-Sense)</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch P S 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">The target fades from view, becoming trans- parent so that they can move unnoticed. Invisi- bility gives the targeted character the Invisible (#) status (p.&nbsp;52), where the number after the status becomes the threshold on any tests to see the character. The Invisible (Improved) spell gives the Improved Invisibility (#) status, which is es- sentially the same but works against cameras and other technology as well as against living entities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mask (Multi-Sense)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Physical Mask (Multi-Sense)</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch P S 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes you don’t want to be seen; other times, you want to be seen as someone you are not. Mask is for the latter. The spell changes the critical characteristics of the person&mdash;their appear- ance, their sound, their scent, and so forth. Roll Sorcery + Magic and record the number of hits; those hits are used as a threshold when people try to see through the illusion, which requires an Will- power + Intuition test. Mask affects only living, sentient beings; Physical Mask affects cameras, mi- crophones, and other technology.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Phantasm (Multi-Sense)</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS(A) M S 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trid Phantasm (Multi-Sense)</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS(A) P S 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">With this spell, the caster projects a partic- ular image into the area of effect (along with accompanying sounds and smells). Maybe it’s the image of an attacking dragon, or a peaceful garden, or of a specific individual&mdash;whatever it is, it has to be something the caster has seen be- fore, and the phantasm must stay in their line of sight. The spellcaster rolls Sorcery + Magic; the net hits from the threshold of any Willpower + Intuition tests viewers must make to see through the illusion. Phantasm affects every living being that sees the effect; Trid Phantasm affects cameras, micro- phones, and other technology.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sensor Sneak (Multi-Sense)</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch P S 2</p>
<p class="calibre1">Improved Invisibility and Physical Mask and the like are great when you want to hide from both pry- ing eyes and technology, but what about when there are no living beings around, only cameras, sensors, and the like? Sensor Sneak is the spell for that. It gives the target a version of the Invisible (Improved) (#) status, but it has no effect on living and sentient beings, only technology-based sensors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC // SPELLS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manipulation Spells Manipulation spells are about shifting real- ity, bending and twisting it to your will. The world is an untidy, unwieldy place, and this set of spells helps you re-arrange it to something much more amenable to you. Sadly, the world often resists your attempts to make it what it should be. That, of course, just means you have to work harder. Manipulation spells target either living or non- living things. The resistance rolls for each spell are specified in the spell descriptions. Spells targeting nonliving things are resisted with their Object Re- sistance (see p.&nbsp;129). Net hits on the Spellcasting test determine the duration of the spell, and for nonliving objects, it also determines how much material is affected. Many Manipulation spells have limited durations and last for a number of minutes equal to the net hits on the Spellcasting test. The default amount of nonliving material affected is one-half cubic me- ter per net hit. See the Volume Reference table for information on how to translate cubic meters of material into common objects.</p>
<p class="calibre1">volume reference table</p>
<p class="calibre1">NET HITS RESULT EXAMPLE 1 hit ½ cubic meter Basic refrigerator 2 hits 1 cubic meter Full-size couch 3 hits 1 ½ cubic meters Motorcycle 4 hits 2 cubic meters Dumpster 5 hits 2 ½ cubic meters Dining room table and eight chairs 6 hits 3 cubic meters Michelangelo’s David</p>

<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS P L 5 Animate Wood</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS P L 4 A chunk of material of the affected type comes to life, moving as commanded by the spellcast- er. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs.&nbsp;Object Resistance of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the item/material being animated. Use the Volume Reference table (see left column) to determine how much material is animated. The material can move according to its form, but generally it should not be faster than 5 meters per combat round un- less it is a wheeled vehicle or something else with innate speed. The object is generally not capable of coordinated movements, so attacks from ani- mated objects are slow and easily blocked. Still, it might be able to level a blow at a motionless or unwary target, doing 4P damage if it’s metal, 3P if stone, 2S if wood, 1S if plastic. Commanding the animated substance requires a Minor Action. If someone is trying to keep the object from following your commands, use Spell- casting net hits + 4 (for metal), 3 (for stone), 2 (for wood), or 1 (for plastic) vs.&nbsp;opponent’s Body + Strength to see if the object is impeded from acting on the command. Choosing a spell can get tricky in that few ob- jects are made of entirely one material&mdash;tables may be wood or plastic, but with metal in them. Choose the material that is predominant in the ob- ject to be animated and use that spell. The magic that inhabits the majority of the material is able to carry the other material along for the ride.</p>
<p class="calibre1">animate wood example Kumiho is in a tough spot. Her teammates are pinned down at a garage exit, and she has to cross an office floor and get down two flights of stairs to meet them. She could use some help. Ahead of her is a long table&mdash;since this is a nice office, it’s made of wood, not plastic. She casts Animate Wood on it as she runs by. Kumiho has Sorcery 6 and Magic 5, and the Object Resistance of a wooden table is 3. Kumiho rolls 3 hits to the table’s 2, which is 1 net hit, enough to animate ½ cubic meter of material. The table is small enough that the entire thing can be animated. As Kumiho runs by, she has the table slip into the hallway behind her, blocking pursuit. It isn’t exactly attacking, but the gamemaster decides one of Kumi- ho’s pursuers should make an Athletics + Agility test to avoid the table, giving the test a threshold of 3 due to the length of the table and its unexpected movement. With only one hit, the chaser cannot avoid the table and smacks into it, taking the 2S damage from wood. The guard can try to absorb the damage with their Body rating; after that, they’ll need to get by the table to continue pursuit. Kumiho has to deal with 4 Drain from the spell; roll- ing Charisma 6 + Willpower 5 gives her 11 dice and 3 hits. She’ll gladly take the 1S damage if the table keeps hindering the opposition.</p>

<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch P S 4 Your magic fills the body of the target, harden- ing it and making it better able to absorb damage. Roll Sorcery + Magic and add net hits to the tar- get’s Defense Rating.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Control Actions</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS M L 4 The spellcaster acts as master puppeteer, taking control of another person and making them dance to their tune. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs.&nbsp;Willpower + Logic; net hits give the maximum duration of the spell in minutes. The target is aware of what is happening to them but can do little about it. The caster uses the same actions to command the individual as the ac- tion they are telling them to take, so that having them move is a Minor Action, but having them at- tack is a Major Action. This spell can be made into an area spell by us- ing the Increase Area adjustment. Once the spell is cast, the effect stays with individuals who did not resist the spell, even if they move out of the initial area.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Control Thoughts</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS M L 4 Similar to Control Actions but more insidious, this puts the spellcaster inside the head of the target, mak- ing them think what the spellcaster wants them to. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs.&nbsp;Willpower + Logic; net hits give the maximum duration of the spell in minutes. Unlike Control Actions, the target’s awareness of Control Thoughts being used on them is uncer- tain. The closer the thoughts are to the target’s nor- mal thoughts, the less likely they are to notice the intrusion. At the gamemaster’s discretion, they can have the target make a Logic + Intuition test after the spell wears off to recognize the spell’s effect on them with a threshold based on how different from normal their thoughts were made to be. While the spellcaster plays a powerful role in shaping the individual’s thoughts, certain instincts are very difficult to override. Thoughts like “I should jump off this building” or “I should at- tack my best friend/spouse/partner” are generally going to be resisted. With thoughts such as these, the gamemaster can have the target roll another Willpower + Logic test to resist the suggestion, and they may gain Edge before the test if the thought is too far outside their normal thought process or if it violates their basic instincts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Darkness</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS(A) P S 3 Light</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS(A) P S 3 These spells are two sides of the same coin, changing the light level of your environment to suit you. For each net hit, you can raise (using Light) or lower (using Darkness) the light level of the sur- rounding area, which may help gain when it comes to determing Edge based on Environment and Visi- bility (p.&nbsp;118). These are area spells, and they can be adjusted using Increase Area and Shift Area.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elemental Armor</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch M S 5 This works the same as the Armor spell (above), though it provides an added bonus. When casting the spell, you choose one element to protect the target from. Depending on the choice, the target cannot acquire certain statuses, as listed in the Ele- mental Protection table. They still may be damaged by a weapon or spell that does the type of damage from which you are protected&mdash;for example, if you have cooling armor, you still may be damaged by a Fireball blast if the initial attack roll is success- ful and you do not soak all the damage, but you would not gain the Burning status afterward.</p>

Roll Sorcery + Magic vs.&nbsp;Object Resistance. For each net hit, you can fling half a kilogram of material into the air, and net hits also act as a threshold for a Reaction + Intuition test for targets to avoid the object. The flung ob- ject has the following Attack Ratings: Close (Mag- ic), Near: (Magic + 2), Medium (Magic + 1), Far: (Magic &ndash; 2), Extreme: &mdash;, and it does Stun damage equal to kilograms of weight, rounded up.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Focus Burst</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV Touch M L 7 Foci can be powerful aids for magicians, but who hasn’t found themselves wanting to eke out a little more power from them every now and then? With Focus Burst, you can get a little more out of your focus or give someone else a boost. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs.&nbsp;focus Force x 2. If you get any net hits, increase the effective rating of the focus by 1 for (net hits) minutes. A critical glitch on the Spellcasting test permanently reduces the Force of the focus by 2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Levitate</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS P S 6 It may not be exactly the same as flight, but hey, it’s defying gravity, and it’s a blast. Roll Sorcery + Magic; for each hit, you can levitate 50 kilos worth of material or people. If it’s the latter and the per- son is not particularly interested in being levitated, they can make a Body + Strength test, with each hit reducing your effective hits by 1. The target has to stay in sight if you want them to stay in the air; the minute they’re out of sight, they’ll be earthward bound. That, along with a sense of caution about raising someone too high when spells can be interrupted, tends to put a cap on how high people are sent up into the air with this spell. The target does not have to hover. They can be moved by the caster at a rate of (caster’s Magic rating) meters per turn. Moving them requires a Minor Action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mana Barrier</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS (A) M S 5 Want a spirit-free room? Want a way to enforce your bar’s “no foci” policy? Then a mana barrier is the way to go. This invisible wall (visible only on the astral) will let people and non-magical objects through with no noticeable effect, but spirits, foci, dual-natured beings, alchemical preparations, re- agents, and spells can’t get through. Astrally project- ing mages can’t get through, either (though they can always try to go around). Unless they fight their way through, which they sometimes do, but it’s good to make them struggle sometimes. To cast a mana bar- rier, roll Sorcery + Magic; (net hits + caster’s Magic) is the Structure rating of the astral wall you create. At the basic level, the spell creates a two-meter- by-two-meter barrier. The Increase Area effect can be added to add up to two meters in length and width (but not depth) for each time the effect is chosen The barrier can be shaped as desired by the caster. For more information on mana barriers, see p. 161.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Overclock</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS P S 4 Magic does not always get along with tech, but sometimes they find a way to combine forces. With this spell, a mage can briefly amp up an electron- ic device’s power, making it run better and faster. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs.&nbsp;Object Resistance. For each net hit, you can increase an attribute of the device (Device Rating, Attack, Data Processing, Firewall, or Sleaze) by 1. The caster can decide to not use some net hits if they want to reduce wear and tear on the device. This use of magic strains the device. After the spell is dropped, the device takes Matrix Damage equal to net hits, resisted by Firewall.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Physical Barrier</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS (A) P S 6 Sometimes you want to keep magic away from you, and other times you want to keep absolutely ev- erything you can away. Physical Barrier builds a wall where you want it to be, with a Structure rating equal to (Magic + hits on a Sorcery + Magic test). The base spell casts a barrier that is two meters by two meters, two centimeters thick. The Increase Area effect can be applied to add up to two meters in length and width (but not depth) for each time the effect is chosen.</p>

<p class="calibre1">These spells give you the ability to make the selected material malleable&mdash;putty in your (men- tal) hands, essentially. You can shape the materi- al as long as the spell is sustained; when the spell is dropped, the material retains whatever form you gave it. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs.&nbsp;Object Re- sistance; the amount of material you can shape is determined by net hits on that test. You can shape 1 cubic meter of material per net hit (see the Vol- ume Reference table, p.&nbsp;139, for information on just how much that is). In order to use this on an object, the object does not have to be entirely made out of the selected material, but it should be pre- dominantly made out of the material.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Strengthen Wall</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS(A) P S 4 Whether you’re trying to solidify a wall that your opponents are trying to breach or cut down the noise from the people that are roller skating or something in the apartment above yours, making an existing wall a little stronger can be useful. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs.&nbsp;Object Resistance for the wall you are trying to affect; net hits increase the Struc- ture rating by 1 per net hit. You can affect four square meters of wall with the base version of this</p>
<p class="calibre1">spell; using the Increase Area effect increases this by four square meters per point of DV added. The Shift Area effect can be used for this spell.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thunder</p>
<p class="calibre1">RANGE TYPE DURATION DV LOS (A) P S 3 A big, loud distraction can be useful, and that’s what this spell offers. By casting it, the magician shapes sound wages into a noise of their choice&mdash;it might sound like the spell’s namesake, or the roar of rush-hour traffic, or the distant babble of shouted voices, or some other such din. The basic area affect- ed by the spell is a two-meter-radius sphere; this can be expanded with the Increase Area effect. For each hit on the Sorcery + Magic test, the noise continues for 1 combat round after the spell is dropped by the caster. Net hits serve as a negative dice pool modifier on those trying to hear other noises in the area.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Counterspelling Counterspelling is the equal and opposite re- action to spellcasting. Magicians give benefits through spells, while other magicians use their gifts to take them the hell away. Counterspelling is a spellcaster’s quick reaction defense, and it comes in one of two forms: boosted defense and dispelling.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Boosted Defense This is the pre-emptive defense, where spellcast- ers try to block an incoming spell. To use it, char- acters take a Counterspell Major Action and roll a Sorcery + Magic test. At its base, the action affects a sphere in the caster’s LOS with a two-meter radius (the radius can be increased by 1 meter per dram of reagents spent). Net hits on the test are added to the dice pool of anyone in the area to defend against any spells. This boost lasts for a number of combat rounds equal to the Magic of the spellcaster.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dispelling This is for use against spells that are sustained or otherwise have ongoing effects. The character chooses the Counterspell action and then rolls Sorcery + Magic vs.&nbsp;Drain Value of the spell x 2 (including any adjustments made to the spell when it was cast). Net hits on this test cancel net hits on the spell on a one-to-one basis; when net hits reach zero, the spell is completely dispelled.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ritual Spellcasting While spellcasting is the quick manipulation of mana, ritual spellcasting shapes mana over a longer period of time. More time allows you to manipulate mana in ways that normal spellcasting won’t allow. Rituals, like spells and alchemical preparations, are learned individually, and they all have the same Kar- ma cost as spells. Rituals can be performed by either one person or a group. Spells learned through nor- mal channels can be incorporated into some rituals, such as a Combat spell in the Prodigal Spell ritual (p.&nbsp;145); in those cases, they do not cost additional Karma to learn separately. To cast a ritual, follow these steps:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 1: Choose a Ritual Leader Each ritual must have a leader who knows the ritual being performed and can complete the last</p>
<p class="calibre1">step, which seals the ritual. In this step, the par- ticipants must announce their participation with the leader. The participants do not need to have learned the ritual; they simply must be willing to take part. All effects from the ritual have the lead- er’s astral signature (p.&nbsp;159). Each participant who is not of the same tradition as the leader suffers a &ndash;2 dice pool penalty on all actions for this ritual. If you’re casting a ritual all alone, you’re the leader.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 2: Choose the Ritual The leader must choose the ritual to perform. If required, the leader also chooses the spell that will be included as part of the ritual. If the ritual re- quires knowledge of a spell or spell category, only the leader needs to know them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 3: Set Up the Foundation A ritual must be performed in a magical lodge ap- propriate to the leader’s tradition, which is referred to as the foundation for the ritual. This can be a per- manent magical lodge (p.&nbsp;129), or a temporary one created using reagents (p.&nbsp;153). Once the lodge is ac- tive, no participant (except a spotter, if the ritual calls for one) may leave the foundation until the ritual is complete without causing the ritual to fail.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 4: Spend Reagents The leader must expend the amount of reagents specified for the ritual. The leader may expend more reagents to reduce Drain when sealing the ritual (step 6). For every dram of pure reagents spent (after the initial offering), the Drain Value is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 2. Even if you’re not spending reagents, you’ll still be spending a little time on this step making the foundation ready for the ritual.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 5: Perform the Ritual During this step, the actual ritual is performed. The duration of this step is specific to each ritual (it’s in the description).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 6: Seal the Ritual The final step in any ritual is sealing it, which completes the ritual. The leader makes a Sorcery + Magic test, with a threshold determined by the ritual. The other participants may join in a Team-</p>
<p class="calibre1">143</p>
<p class="calibre1">RITUAL SPELLCASTING // MAGIC</p>
<p class="calibre1">144</p>
<p class="calibre1">work test to boost the leader’s dice pool. Each ritu- al’s description explains how the net hits from the sealing step are used, if at all. After the spell effect goes off, each participant must deal with drain equal to the number of hits on a Ritual Threshold x 2 test (minimum 2) as described on page 131. If the number of hits the leader got on their Sealing test was higher than their Magic rating, this drain is Physical; otherwise it’s Stun.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ritual Failure There are a number of rare things that could cause a ritual to fail prematurely. If a participant leaves the foundation after Step 3 of the ritual but before the ritual is complete, the ritual fails. If the leader is inca- pacitated (or killed) before Step 6, the ritual collapses and fails. If the foundation is disrupted or broken at any point after Step 3, the ritual fails. When a ritual fails, every participant imme- diately suffers drain. Make a test by rolling dice equal to the ritual’s threshold; the drain is equal to twice the number of hits on this test in Stun damage. Any reagents you’ve already spent in Step 4 are wasted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Glitches A glitch on a ritual in any step could result in extra Drain (e.g., +2 Drain Value), an increase of 1 to the threshold of the ritual, or the leader being forced to seal the ritual on their own. On a critical glitch, anything goes (prepare to put down a rogue minion, or find that you missed your target, or find that what you intended to be a healing circle re- ally is an astral gateway and everybody just got dumped on some metaplane, or something equally unpleasant that your gamemaster thinks up).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rituals These are the rituals you can learn and cast. You learn each ritual the same way you learn a spell (p.&nbsp;130). Some rituals have keywords, which have special rules, just like the keywords for spells. Anchored: All anchored rituals must be placed on a physical object or symbol of mystical significance that serves as the ritual’s focal point. This could be something used specifically for the ritual (a rock or a doorway to anchor a ward, for example), or a mys- tical inscription (written in ink, paint, blood, etch marks, etc.), or even the foundation itself. The an- chor cannot be moved relative to the Gaiasphere (the planet) during the duration of the ritual’s effect, or the ritual collapses and the effect ends early. Material Link: The ritual requires a material link to the target, something that was once a part of the target. Material links from living beings aren’t usable in rituals forever&mdash;the Material Links sidebar (p. 145) has all the details.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Minion: The ritual creates a semi-autonomous entity, usually something to help the magician who makes it. Whatever minion is created is bound to the ritual leader, who can’t have more minions at a time than their Charisma rating. Spell: This ritual is used in conjunction with a spell that the ritual leader knows. Some of its prop- erties might change&mdash;the ritual has details on how. If the leader has any modifiers to the spell from a men- tor spirit, the modifiers apply to the ritual, too. These rituals are susceptible to dispelling (p.&nbsp;143). Spotter: If the ritual’s target is not in sight of the leader, the leader needs to designate someone who can see the target for them, referred to as the spotter. The individual acting as the spotter must be a mem- ber of the group casting the ritual&mdash;or a spirit serving a member of that group&mdash;and must be able to as- trally perceive the target. The spotter must be present in the ritual’s foundation when the ritual begins and then must travel physically or astrally to where they can assense the target of the spell; this is an exception to the “no leaving” rule in Step 3 of ritual casting. The target does not have to be astrally active (and it’s often safer for the spotter if they aren’t); the spotter merely must be able to assense them to establish the necessary mystic link. If the spell is an area spell, the spotter must be able to assense the target location. For the duration of the ritual, a link is present be- tween the spotter’s aura and the ritual group. If the spotter is noticed by the target, it is possible to use the link to track them back to the ritual team’s physical location. The spotter doesn’t make a Teamwork test with the rest of the participants but still suffers the same drain as everyone else.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Circle of Healing (Anchored, Spell) Threshold: 7 This ritual is used to cast a Health spell on a number of targets at once. Even though it’s called a circle, it creates a sphere around the anchor that has a radius in meters equal to the leader’s Mag- ic rating. This ritual takes five hours to complete. The net hits from the sealing step are used as the net hits for the spell and applied as a positive dice- pool modifier to any healing tests performed in the circle. If the spell has a particular elemental aspect (e.g., Cooling Heal or Warming Heal), that is also applied to individuals in the circle. The circle lasts for a number of days equal to the net hits on the sealing step.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Circle of Protection (Anchored) Threshold: 6 The circle of protection is a small astral and physical barrier. Even though it’s called a circle,</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC // RITUALS</p>
<p class="calibre1">material link A material link is something that is an integral part of the target. If the target is an inanimate object, the link has to be something that is an essential part of the object’s structure. A brick from a wall could be a material link; a picture hanging on the wall or other loose object from inside the building could not. If the target is a living being, it must be a tissue sample. Tissue samples, however, decompose over time and cease to become viable as a material link. Hair, blood and other bodily fluids, nail clippings, and so on are viable for a four to five hours, while a finger or larger tissue sample (such as the proverbial pound of flesh) can last three to four days before it decays too much to be a viable link. Chemical preservation methods instantly de- stroy the sample’s viability as a material link, but frozen sam- ples can be used for up to a year.</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s actually a sphere that forms around the anchor that has a radius in meters equal to the leader’s Magic rating. The circle acts as a combination of the Physical Barrier and Mana Barrier spells (p. 141) with a Structure rating equal to the (Magic rating of the ritual leader + final Sorcery test net hits). The mana barrier is dual-natured. The barrier lasts for a number of hours equal to the net hits from the sealing step. Anyone or any- thing within the barrier is protected from outside physical objects and magical attacks. If something crosses the barrier from the inside, then the ward ends. This ritual takes four hours to perform.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Curse (Material Link, Spell) Threshold: 5 A Curse allows an Illusion spell to be cast on a subject through a material link rather than a mystic link from observing the subject. A Curse can be used on any target, whether within visu- al range of the leader or not, provided there is a link to the target. If the spell applies to multiple targets, then the ritual must have a link to each of the targets. The link is used as part of the offering and is de- stroyed during the ritual. The spell is cast normally (using teamwork, if applicable) with all the tests and appropriate Drain. For the duration of the ritual, a link is present between the target and the ritual group while the spell portion is sustained. It is possible to spot the link astrally and track it back to the ritual team’s physical location. This ritual requires three hours to complete.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prodigal Spell (Spell, Spotter) Threshold: 6 This ritual allows you to cast any Combat spell at a distant target that is out of line of sight of your ritual team. The Combat spell can be either direct</p>
<p class="calibre1">or indirect. Direct combat spells travel to the tar- get in astral space. Indirect combat spells travel to the target in physical space, requiring a clear (but not necessarily straight) path in the physical world between the ritual team and target in order for the spell to reach its destination&mdash;the spell flies from the foundation to the target, dodging any obstacles in its path. This ritual requires four hours to perform.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Remote Sensing (Spell, Spotter) Threshold: 5 This ritual allows you to cast any Detection spell with an even greater range. The area of the spell is increased to (Magic rating of ritual leader + total hits on Sorcery test in Step 6) x 100 meters. The spell’s subject must be present in the founda- tion during the ritual but may then take their new sense outside the foundation while the ritual par- ticipants sustain the spell. All of the participants of the ritual perceive the same thing the subject perceives through the spell. If the spell has a target (like when you use a Mind Link or a Mind Probe spell in the ritual), you’ll need a spotter to have eyes on the target. This ritual takes three hours to perform. After- ward, if any of the participants stops sustaining the ritual, it ends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Renascence (Anchored, Spell) Threshold: 6 This ritual sustains and maintains an area Ma- nipulation spell for a time. The area of the spell is a sphere with a radius equal to the leader’s Magic rating, and the effect is based on the net hits from the sealing step. The base duration of the effect is 1 hour, which is doubled for each net hit from the sealing step of the ritual. This ritual takes four hours to perform.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ward (Anchored) Threshold: 6 The ward is a basic ritual, taught to many ma- gicians. It creates a mana barrier (p.&nbsp;161) with a rating equal to the net hits on the Sorcery test in Step 6 of the ritual. The ward may encompass a volume of up to fifty cubic meters times the sum of the participants’ Magic ratings. This ritual takes four hours to complete. The ward lasts for a number of weeks equal to the net hits from the sealing step of the ritual. If the leader spends 6 Karma, the ward is permanent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">145</p>
<p class="calibre1">RITUALS // MAGIC</p>
<p class="calibre1">Watcher (Minion) 146 Threshold: 4 Watchers are like spirits, but in actuality are entities born from the ritual leader’s own mind rather than the metaplanes. They are a creation of mana, woven with the personalities of the ritual participants. A watcher can speak any language its creators (which includes the leader and participants) can speak. A watcher is bound only to the leader of the ritual and follows their orders. A watcher lasts for a number of hours equal to the (net hits on the sealing test x 3). A watcher’s attributes and skills start at 2. For each additional hour spent on the ritual, these increase by one, as does the ritual’s threshold. A leader can dismiss a watcher bound to them as a Minor Action. Watchers cannot be banished or counter- spelled. This ritual takes one hour to perform.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Conjuring Many hands make light work, and that’s true even when those hands are ghostly and insubstantial. The Sixth World is host to a range of spirits, visitors from other planes who take on characteristics of air, earth, fire, water, beasts, or even people. Their exact nature is eternally debated&mdash;are they echoes of forms here on earth? Departed souls? Both? Something else?&mdash;but their utility is clear. The conjuration of spirits can be very useful to the Awakened, bringing them assistants with a range of skills and abilities to help out the sum- moner. Whether they serve as scouts, directly attack an enemy, or mess with opponents’ strategies, spirits can give a big boost to a shadowrunner team&mdash;or present them with a tremendous pain in the hoop. Characters do two things when they conjure a spirit. First, they summon them, that is, make them appear; and second, they compel them to perform a certain number of services, based on the power of the summoning. Let’s look at those two things in turn.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Summoning To summon a spirit, decide on the Force of the spirit you want to conjure (based on the power you want the conjured spirit to have) and roll Conjuring + Magic vs.&nbsp;(Force x 2). At least one net hit is needed to successfully summon the spirit. Services obtained are equal to net hits. Characters must then resist drain as if they cast a spell against a Drain Value equal to the number of hits (not net hits) the spirit rolled. This is Stun damage unless it is higher than the character’s Magic rank, in which case it is Physical. if the drain is enough to make the summoner un- conscious, the spirit returns to its home metaplane. Spirits have a built-in time limit: once one sunrise and one sunset (or the other way around) pass after the summoning, the spirit returns to its home plane, even if it has not fulfilled all of its services. And yes, that means conjurers in the polar regions go a little nuts during each solstice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC // CONJURING</p>
<p class="calibre1">You can spend reagents equal to the Force of the spirit you are attempting to summon to gain a bonus point of Edge. You cannot have active spir- its whose combined Force is greater than (sum- moner’s Magic x 3) at any one time. Spirits can be fought with anything that affects astral beings, or with regular weapons if they ma- terialize. They have one Condition Monitor, based on their Willpower, and if it is filled, the spirit is disrupted and sent back to their home metaplane.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Services A service is a single, discrete, clearly defined action. “Do everything I say,” or “Keep me safe” are too broad to be considered services. “Take this package to Mr.&nbsp;Johnson at the research facility” or “Distract those guards for ten minutes” are more specific and acceptable. We can’t draw the exact line of what is an acceptable service and what is not. Gamemasters have the final say in that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Banishing Banishing is the flip side of Summoning, trying to eliminate a spirit that is somehow messing with your plans. To attempt to banish a spirit, use a Major Ac- tion to roll Conjuring + Magic vs.&nbsp;(spirit’s Force x 2). Any net hits reduce the services the spirit has left to ful- fill by one per net hit. Once those services are reduced to zero, the spirit departs to its home metaplane.</p>
<p class="calibre1">conjuring and banishing example Sometimes the best person to battle a shadowrunner is another shadowrunner, which is how Cass Wandering Horse and Kumiho find themselves trying to outrace each other to catch up to a Renraku exec they’re supposed to extract. Cass decides a spirit will be great for running in- terference in this matter. He opts for the pure speed and concealability of a spirit of air and decides Force 4 will be strong enough to cause the other team difficulties. He has Conjuring 4 and Magic 6, giving him 10 dice to roll on his test. The gamemaster rolls Force x 2, or 8 dice, for the spir- it. Cass gets 3 hits, but the spirit gets 2. Cass has gained one service. He also has to resist 2 drain; he rolls 11 dice on Charisma + Willpower and gets 3 hits, so he takes no dam- age. He gives the spirit a simple command: “slow down the black Americar behind me.” Kumiho is in that Americar, conducting astral over- watch, which helps her notice the spirit coming her way. She could try to fight it off, but she decides banishment might be more efficient. She has Conjuring 5 and Magic 5, so she rolls 10 dice, and the spirit once again has Force x 2 dice, which is 8. The spirit does pretty well, getting 3 hits, but Kumiho gets 4. The 1 net hit cancels 1 service, which happens to be the only service the spirit has, so it goes back to its home metaplane. Kumiho has to resist drain equal to the hits the spirit got x 2, which is 6 Drain. She has 11 dice to roll and gets 5 hits, leaving her 1 Stun damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As is the case with summoning, banishing brings drain, which is equal to twice the number of hits (not net hits) the spirit got on the test to resist the banishment. As with summoning, if the final drain is higher than the banisher’s Magic, the drain damage is Physical; otherwise it’s Stun. Spending reagents equal to the Force of the spir- it you are attempting to banish gives you a point of bonus Edge.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirits and Edge Spirits cannot gain Edge for themselves or their summoner, but they still have an Attack Rating in case the defender gains Edge. Their summoner or an ally can spend 2 Edge to give the spirit 1 Edge as per normal rules, which the spirit can then use normally. The spirit must be within (Force x 10) meters of anyone who wishes to give it Edge.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Types of Spirits This book contains six types of spirit&mdash;spirits of air, beasts, earth, fire, kin, and water. Four of those are elemental spirits, while the other two resemble animals and people. Their stats are here; their list- ings refer to powers described on p.&nbsp;221. Each spirit receives an optional power for every 3 full points of Force (so Force 1&ndash;2 spirits have no optional powers, Force 3&ndash;5 have one, Force 6&ndash;8 have two, and so on). The summoner selects the optional powers at the time of summoning, and they cannot be changed once the spirit is sum- moned. Spirits’ stats are based on their Force (abbrevi- ated F in the stat blocks). A spirit’s attribute cannot be lower than one, even if the adjustment listed would make it so. Any skills they have are at a rank equal to their Force.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Spirit Mindlink A conjured spirit is linked to its conjurer so that they do not need to speak to communicate. They share a mental communication that can cross any physical distance but cannot cross from one meta- plane to another. The communication is conceptu- al in nature, which means it cannot share actual audio, video, or pictures. This link means that if a conjured spirit is disrupted or banished, the con- jurer knows immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit Range Spirits try to stay close to their conjurer. If they get more than (conjurer’s Magic rating x 100) meters from their conjurer, they will try to return within that range unless they have specifically been directed not to.</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC // CONJURING</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit Etiquette It’s always worth remembering that spirits are being compelled by magic power into services about which they have no say, whether the actions they’re taking are moral, illegal, enjoyable, painful, or hurtful cannot affect their decisions to follow that action; if something painful or unpleasant is part of a service, they still have to do it. This can affect their attitude toward conjurers, and per- haps more importantly, it can affect an individual’s reputation among spirits. Since spirits have been known to share their thoughts openly, this reputa- tion can spread. Any time a conjurer deliberately uses a service to cause a spirit they conjured signif- icant discomfort or disruption, decrease the char- acter’s Reputation by 1.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enchanting A lamp that grants wishes, a ring that makes you invisible, a potion that heals the drinker&mdash;these and more magic items are embedded deep in the mythologies of the world. When magic returned to the world, the ability to at least simulate some of these items came into existence, though they can- not always duplicate the vast powers of myth. But when you can throw an empty bottle that explodes into an ice storm, or you can slip an executive a pencil that becomes a listening device when they pick it up, you shouldn’t complain about limita- tions, because awesome is in your reach. Enchanting has two different branches&mdash;al- chemy, which involves the creation of objects that store spells, and artificing, which involves making items that aid magic use. We’ll cover each in turn.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alchemy The ancient art of alchemy was concerned with turning lead into gold, brewing potions, or craft- ing stones that confer immortality. While some of modern alchemy’s aims are not so far different, the techniques have become more refined, and the uses are far more vast. In the Sixth World, alchemy is about making preparations, which are objects im- bued with spells. They provide a chance for spell- casters to trigger their magic in different ways. The trade-off is that the spells are generally less power- ful than their cast-on-the-fly equivalents. Preparations have four key elements: The spell embedded in the preparation, the trigger that will make that spell go off, the Force of the prepara- tion, and its Potency, which measures how its pow- er declines over time. Each of these elements are discussed in the Making a Preparation section. Preparations are imbued with magic by their creator, and that means they carry their creator’s astral signature. They can be recognized with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">149</p>
<p class="calibre1">ENCHANTING // MAGIC</p>
<p class="calibre1">150</p>
<p class="calibre1">successful Astral + Intuition test. The aura fades at the same rate as a cast spell (p.&nbsp;159).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Choosing an Object Making a preparation requires selecting the right object. It has to be something the magician can lift and manipulate, and the process of mak- ing it into a preparation leaves a mark or change on it that can be recognized by a Perception + In- tuition (3) test by someone who has the Arcana Knowledge skill (or something similar enough). Balls, potions, bullets, projectiles, and small office items are some of the more popular objects to use in preparations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Making a Preparation Once you have chosen an object, you follow a four-step process outlined here.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 1: Choose a Spell If you want a preparation to trigger a spell, you have to choose the spell it will trigger. You can only use a spell you know. If you want to use Amp Up or Increase Area effects, choose how many of them to apply now (remember how many were selected when it comes time to apply drain in Step 5). Shift Area does not apply to preparations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 2: Choose a Trigger If the preparation is ever going to make its im- bued spell go off, it needs a trigger. There are three basic types: command, contact, and time. Command: The individual who made the prepa- ration can trigger it by an act of will. They must be on the physical plane and have a line of sight to the preparation to set off this trigger. Triggering the preparation requires a Minor Action. A command trigger adds 2 drain to the preparation, and it is the only trigger that Health spells can use. Contact: Perhaps the simplest trigger, this spell goes off when the next living material being touches it. Contact triggers add 1 drain to the preparation. Time: When using this trigger, the character se- lects an amount of time, and when the creation of the preparation is finished, the clock starts ticking down on this time period. When the time is com- plete, the spell goes off. The time cannot be greater, in hours, than the Potency of the preparation. If the Potency ends up being less than the time, the spell fizzles as the Potency runs out. A time trigger adds 2 drain to the preparation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 3: Create the Preparation Once all the decisions are made, you have to actu- ally make the preparation, which takes a number of hours equal to the total drain of the spell (after any effects and the drain from triggers are added). Getting everything crafted just right takes time, and precision is needed&mdash;one wrong glyph, and instead of having a vicious fireball that roasts your enemies to a crisp, you have a spell that warms them nicely on a cold day and dries out their socks. That simply won’t do. Reagents can be used at this stage to channel mana into the preparation, putting less of a strain on the en- chanter. Reagents can be used to reduce the Drain Val- ue by the number of drams employed (up to 2). At the end of this step, the enchanter makes an Enchanting + Magic test opposed by the Drain Value of the preparation. Net hits on this test be- come the Potency of the preparation and should be recorded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 4: Resist Drain All the detailed work on the preparation, com- bined with the effort of channeling mana into an object, is exhausting. The total Drain Value for a preparation is spell Drain Value (with adjustments) + trigger Drain Value &ndash; drams of reagents used (up to 2). The enchanter uses their tradition attribute + Willpower to reduce that drain. If the Drain Value left after rolling to reduce it is greater than your Magic rating, any Drain suffered is Physical; oth- erwise it’s Stun Damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Finished Preparation The spell, trigger, and Potency of the prepa- ration should all be noted, along with any spell effects added. The preparation maintains its full power for [Potency x 2] hours; after that, pow- er starts to decrease. With each [current Potency x 2] hour interval after that, the Potency of the preparation decreases by 1. When it reaches 0, the preparation fizzles, and the magic inside is lost.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Using a preparation Triggering a preparation is the same as casting a spell, but also different. Instead of rolling Sorcery + Magic, roll Potency of the preparation + Magic of the enchanter. There is no additional drain when the spell is triggered; that was already handled in the creation of the preparation. The range of the spell is also a little different, since it is based on a spell emerging from an inani- mate object. Treat range as follows: Touch: Anyone or anything in direct contact with the preparation when it is triggered is affected</p>

<p class="calibre1">Making a Preparation example Agbele Oku knows the dangers of shadowrunning, and she knows how valuable it is to have some ready-to- roll healing when a run gets going. She has a golf ball&mdash;a special purple ball from miniature golf&mdash;that she loves to use for this purpose. She’s hollowed it out and uses a funnel to put the needed reagent into the center of the ball. For step 1, she has to choose a spell. Sometimes she likes to use a Heal variant, like Cooling Heal or Warming Heal, but she decides to be direct and just go with Heal. The base Drain Value on this spell is 3. Step 2 is for choosing a trigger, but since this is a Health spell, she has to choose command. That adds 2 more drain, making it 5. She has made it to Step 3&mdash;it’s time to make the preparation happen. The Drain Value currently stands at 5, so it’s going to be a five-hour effort. That’s a fair amount of Drain&mdash;thankfully, Agbele Oku has some re- agents in the form of dried skins of an Awakened py- thon, so she spends 1 dram to bring the drain down to 4. The time to make the preparation remains at 5 hours. When those 5 hours pass, she rolls Enchanting 4 + Magic 5 for 9 dice, against the reduced Drain Value of 4. She gets 4 hits, the gamemaster rolls 1, so the preparation has a Potency of 3. She has Potency x 2 hours&mdash;meaning 6 hours&mdash;before the preparation starts to lose power. She might be starting off her mission on the wrong foot, though, if the drain does enough damage to her. She has 4 drain and Magic of 5, so any damage she takes will be Stun. Her tradition attribute is Logic 5 and her Willpower is 6. She rolls 11 dice and pulls off 3 hits. One Stun damage&mdash;she can live with it. It’s time to take the preparation on the road and throw it to whichever team member needs help. If they use it while it’s still at full Potency, it will roll Potency 3 + Magic 5 dice, spreading a quick 8 dice worth of healing power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(if they are the type of thing to be affected by the spell, that is). Line of Sight: If the preparation has a command trigger, which requires line of sight by the enchant- er, then they choose the target when the spell is triggered. Otherwise, the spell hits the closest tar- get with line of sight to it. The range of the spell is limited to [Potency x Magic] meters. Area: The preparation is the center of the spell’s area, and it affects the area around the spell. The sphere has a two-meter radius, plus two meters for each Increase Area effect added. Targets of the spell resist its effects as normal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Artificing One branch of Enchanting is learning the tech- nique to tap into the fundamental power latent</p>
<p class="calibre1">in natural elements and imbue items with magic to aid and enhance a magician’s abilities. The act of creating a magical focus is known as artificing; more information about foci can be found on p. 154. Unlike a preparation, a focus is powerful, re- usable, and intimately tied to its owner. A focus represents a permanent and complex enchantment built up slowly from an arcane formula and fin- ished with Karma. All foci follow the same basic creation process: first, a focus formula is needed, then an appropriate telesma (the material item to be enchanted) is selected. After that the enchant- ment proper is created, and finally the finished fo- cus is bonded. This is how to do it in six steps.</p>
<p class="calibre1">ENCHANTING TERMINOLOGY Focus: (pl. foci) An item personalized to an individual that boosts their magic ability in some area. Preparation: An item that has been imbued with a spell, along with triggering conditions that will make it go off. Preparations can only be used once. Reagents: Items, generally naturally occurring, that have a particular ability to channel and hold magic. Re- agents can be used in shaping telesma, and also in differ- ent parts of the enchanting and spellcasting processes. Talismonger: One who crafts and deals in reagents, telesma, and foci. Telesma: The physical aspect of a focus; telesma plus magic makes a focus. From the Greek root word of “talis- man.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 1: Choose Focus Formula Designing a focus requires a complex arcane recipe known as a focus formula. These formu- las are too complex for metahuman magicians to memorize and must be recorded in some fashion. You can buy focus formulas from lore stores and talismongers. All focus formulae specify the type of focus (spell, spirit, power, weapon, etc.), Force, form (wooden quarterstaff, gold ring, vibroknife, etc.), and tradition of the focus (hermetic, sha- manic, etc.). The formulas sold by talismongers typically use “traditional” forms in widespread magical traditions (wands, magical amulets, rune-carved swords, etc.)&mdash;which is why a lot of magicians commonly create their own for- mulas (which is advanced magic for a future book). The focus formula must be for a Force that is equal to or less than your Magic rank&mdash; you cannot make foci with a Force greater than your Magic rank.</p>
<p class="calibre1">151</p>
<p class="calibre1">ENCHANTING // MAGIC</p>
<p class="calibre1">152</p>
<p class="calibre1">OBTAINING FOCUS INGREDIENTS If player characters decide to get into the focus-mak- ing business, this is a great opportunity for the gamemas- ter to frame lots of stories for them. Sure, you could have them visit Murray, the local talismonger, and have him sell the characters what they need (cost guidelines can be found on p.&nbsp;168), and in some campaigns that might be appropriate to keep the larger story moving, but the search for formulae, reagents, and telesma can be key parts of entertaining, long-lasting role-playing stories. Finding the right formula might require tracking down John Dee’s library, now hidden in the Royal College of Physicians, London; finding reagents may mean a trip to Eastern Europe to find the extremely rare austras koks tree; and a search for telesma may send players on a hunt for an amethyst ring rumored to have belonged to Queen Cleopatra. Don’t miss out on a great story opportunity when the players go seeking rare magic!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 2: Obtain the Telesma Before you can create a focus, you need to acquire an item that matches the form defined in the focus formula. An object being prepared for enchantment in this manner is known as a telesma. Obtaining telesma may be simple or complex&mdash;if the formula calls for a knife it may be no more difficult than buy- ing a blade from the local Weapons World franchise, but if the formula calls for a flute carved from the bones of a California condor, you might need to do some work to track down the item in question. Any inanimate object can serve as the telesma: a wooden wand, a jeweled charm, a weapon, a car, an oddly shaped stone, and so on. The more unprocessed and natural the object, or the more work you performed to craft it, the easier the telesma is to enchant.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 3: Prepare the Magical Lodge You’ll need a magical lodge with a Force at least equal to that of the formula’s Force, and of the same tradition as yourself and the focus for- mula. While you’re there, make sure you add some amenities, because you’re going to be in there for a while.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 4: Spend Reagents Second, you need to spend reagents. The amount you need to spend (in drams) is equal to the amount of Karma the focus requires to be bonded at the Force specified in the focus formula, with a minimum of (Force) drams. These reagents are spent at the start of the process, so they are used up even if you fail or abort the crafting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 5: Craft the Focus Next, you need to spend a number of days equal to the Force of the focus formula. You use this time to gather mana, attuning it to the telesma and working it into the material permanently. You’re actually working sporadically over the course of each day, so you can do other business during this time, but you can’t leave the lodge without ruining your crafting attempt. At the end of the crafting time, it is time for the truly tricky part of the process: invoking the pow- er of the focus. Make an Enchanting + Magic v. formula Force + telesma’s Object Resistance. This counts as the culmination of all your work over the days, and you can’t use Edge for this test. Your net hits from this test, if you succeed, become the actual Force of the focus. If you glitch, you cannot resist drain in the next step. If you critically glitch, the magic spins out of your control and rips away 1 Essence from you&mdash;artificing is not for the weak or untrained.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step 6: Resist Drain The Drain Value is the Force specified by the focus formula, plus 2 for each hit (not net hits) rolled against you in the Enchanting + Magic test in Step 5; since the Force cannot be higher than your Magic rating, the drain does Stun damage. If you’re still conscious after resisting drain, you can spend an amount of Karma equal to the actual Force of the focus to seal the deal and finish the fo- cus. If you fall unconscious or don’t want to keep the result, skip the Karma expenditure and start over (probably after you’ve healed).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Artifact Assensing The Enchanting skill allows you to assense a fo- cus in a way that helps you understand its creator. Make an Opposed Test of Enchanting + Magic vs.&nbsp;twice the Force of the focus. You can use the net hits to learn about the aura of the artificer who crafted it (see Assensing Table, p.&nbsp;159). This can be attempted once a day per focus.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Disenchanting The Enchanting skill can give magic life to ob- jects, but it can also take it away, giving characters the chance to temporarily disrupt or even unweave astral constructs. To deactivate an active focus, make an Enchant- ing + Magic vs.&nbsp;target’s Force + owner’s Magic Op- posed test. You can do this from the physical or astral plane, though you must have line of sight to the focus. If you get more successes on the test, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC // ENCHANTING</p>
<p class="calibre1">focus temporarily deactivates. It can be reactivated with the Activate Focus Minor Action. Enchanting can also be used to effectively recy- cle a focus, as a portion of the freed mana can re- charge spent reagents. To break a focus down into reagents and totally destroy it, a character must have touch contact with it. Breaking down a focus requires an Enchanting + Magic vs.&nbsp;target’s Force (+ owner’s Magic if bonded and if the focus isn’t yours) Opposed test. If you succeed in this test, the focus ceases to be. The telesma at the heart of it disintegrates and is unusable. The mana released from the destruc- tion of the astral construct can be channeled into objects of the magician’s tradition, making them into reagents. Make an Enchanting + Magic test. Every success creates one dram of reagents, up to maximum of one-third of the reagents used in creating the focus (see Step 4 of Artificing, p.&nbsp;152). This process takes a number of hours equal to the target’s Force. Disenchanting also works with alchemical prepa- rations. For rules on this, see Disjoining below. Drain Value for all these tests are 1S per hit (not net hit) rolled against the magician; if the target’s Force exceeds the magician’s Magic rating, the drain is Physical. If the target’s Force exceeds twice their Magic rating, then that item’s a bit more than the mage can handle, and they cannot attempt the Disenchantment. Disjoining Put simply, disjoining is to Alchemy as dispelling is to Spellcasting. Disjoining allows you to remove the magic power from a preparation, making it into an ordinary object again. To disjoin a prepa- ration, you need to have identified the object as a preparation by assensing it (p.&nbsp;159), and you need to touch it to make the attempt. Disjoining takes a Major Action, and you make an Enchanting + Magic Opposed test vs.&nbsp;the preparation’s Force + the alchemist’s Magic Rating (plus any Karma from the fixation metamagic). Every net hit you get reduces the preparation’s Potency by 1. You then take the same amount of drain as you would have if you’d created the preparation yourself. There’s a risk to doing this&mdash;if the preparation has a contact trigger and you fail the test to dis- join it, the preparation activates. Better hope it’s not explosive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reagents Mana infuses people&mdash;the existence of spell- casters and adepts is enough to prove that. But it also flows into critters, minerals, and plants. Ele- ments of those things can become reagents, items imbued with magic that can be used in a variety of magical tasks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The purest of all reagents is the thorough- ly unnatural alloy known as orichalcum, an or- ange-gold metal whose main property seems to be an ability to hold magic. All reagents are com- pared to orichalcum, so that 1 dram of orichalcum is the standard measure of power for reagents. For reference, a dram of orichalcum weighs about 1.77 grams. Reagents come in all types and forms. Orichal- cum can be created through Alchemy, but it’s a lengthy process beyond the reach of everyone but the most sophisticated alchemists. Naturally oc- curring reagents vary by tradition. Hermetic magi- cians prefer minerals, pure elements, old trinkets, and virgin ores. Shamans favor parts of plants and animals, naturally polished rocks, and small, in- tricately crafted handmade items. An Igbo mage might find magic in ofo wood, while an aspected magician might seek natural items that are har- vested under a certain moon. Reagents are surprisingly common, but not all reagents can be used by every tradition. The cube of cinnabar that the hermetic magician values is useless to a shaman, just as the shaman’s bundle of feathers is of little interest to the hermetic mage. Generally speaking, the reagents from one tradi- tion only work at half strength to magicians of other traditions. This makes trading in reagents a tricky proposition to anyone not versed in the fine art of talismongering. Reagents are almost as versatile as mana itself. When you spend a reagent, the mana it stores dis- sipates, which means it ceases to be a reagent, even if its physical form remains intact. Here’s a quick rundown of the many uses of reagents. Alchemical Preparations: You can spend re- agents to reduce the drain from making a prepa- ration. Artificing: You need to spend reagents to create foci. Counterspelling: You can spend reagents to in- crease the area you protect with Counterspelling. Ritual Spellcasting: As part of the offering step, you can spend reagents to offset drain in Ritual Spellcasting (see Ritual Spellcasting, p.&nbsp;143). Summoning: You can spend reagents to gain Edge when summoning spirits. Temporary Magical Lodge: You can create a temporary magical lodge by spending a number of drams of reagents equal to the Force of the lodge. The lodge takes one hour per point of Force to create and thereafter lasts until sunrise or sunset, whichever comes first.</p>

<p class="calibre1">REAGENTS // MAGIC</p>
<p class="calibre1">154</p>
<p class="calibre1">Foci Foci (singular: focus) are specially crafted items made potent with a mana infusion. They are as- tral constructs embedded within physical objects. When active, the design of the astral construct pools mana energy so that the magician who owns it can use that energy for a specific magical task. The physical form of a focus varies&mdash;bracelets, amulets, belts, wands, walking sticks, staves, cups, bottle caps, daggers, hats, hip flasks, pens, and so on and so forth&mdash;although most of the time a fo- cus reflects the tradition of its maker. Foci have a Force rating that measures their power. You can’t use a focus unless you’ve bonded it to yourself (and you can’t bond foci unless you’re Awakened&mdash;I mean, what would you do with it?). The amount of Karma required to bond a focus is different for each focus, listed on the Magical Goods table. Bonding a focus takes an hour per point of Force of the focus, time that is spent con- templating the object and synchronizing its astral signature to yours. Once you’ve spent the Karma and the time, the focus’ power is available to you. A focus can only be bound to one person at a time&mdash;the bonding process breaks the bond with the focus’ previous owner (if it had one). Each focus has a specific power (described un- der Focus Types) and must be active for you to use it. Activating and deactivating a focus is a Minor Action. For a focus to remain active, it must be in the possession of the magician (worn, carried, handheld, in a pocket or pouch, etc.). Likewise, if you lose consciousness, any focus bonded to you deactivates. If you lose possession of a focus, it au- tomatically deactivates and you lose all its benefits until you recover it and activate it again. All foci have auras that are visible from astral space and carry your astral signature (p.&nbsp;159). While activated, a focus also has an astral form. If you use astral projection, you also carry the astral form of any active foci you have. If you deactivate a focus while you’re projecting, its astral form dis- appears. You’ll need to go back to your body to reactivate it. You can’t bond more foci than your Magic at- tribute, and the maximum Force of all your bond- ed foci can’t exceed your Magic x 5. Regardless of the number of bonded foci you have, only one focus may add its Force to a dice pool for any given test. Foci also have a cost in nuyen, as shown in the Foci Cost table.</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC // FOCI</p>
<p class="calibre1">Focus Types There are seven categories of foci: Enchanting, Metamagic, Power, Qi, Spell, Spirit, and Weapon. Foci have the same cost as other foci in their cate- gory, but they don’t all have the same effect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enchanting Foci Alchemical focus: An alchemical focus adds its Force in dice to Enchanting skill tests to create preparations. Disenchanting focus: When a disenchanting focus is in contact with another artifact, the ma- gician can add dice equal to its Force to the Disen- chanting test.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Metamagic Foci Metamagic foci support initiates and the high- er forms of magic they’ve learned. Metamagic foci add their Force to the magician’s initiate grade when using specific metamagics. Centering focus: A centering focus adds its Force to the magician’s initiate grade when they use the centering metamagic on Drain Resistance tests. Flexible signature focus: A flexible signature focus adds its Force to your grade when increasing the thresh- old of observers’ Assensing (Astral + Intuition) tests. Masking focus: When resisting someone else’s Assensing test, add the Force of this focus to your dice pool. It does not increase the number of bond- ed foci you can mask. Spell shaping focus: Treat your Magic rating as if it was increased by the Force of this focus when determining how much you can shape your spells.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Power Foci Power foci live up to their name. They are very powerful foci that temporarily increase your effec- tive Magic rating. That means they add to your Sorcery dice pools whenever you use that skill, along with any other test where Magic is involved. Power foci can take any form, but for some reason, rings and amulets are quite popular.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Qi Foci Qi (pronounced “chee”) foci only work for ad- epts. They channel mana into your adept powers. A qi focus can be an object, like other foci, but it can also be worked into a body modification, like tattoos, ritual scarring, and piercings. Each focus is specific to a single adept power at a specific level. While the focus is active, you get the power con- tained in it, or if you already have the power, the focus’ levels are added to your own (if it’s a power with levels, that is; otherwise there’s no benefit for you). The Force of the focus must be four times the Power Point cost of the power it holds, so a level</p>
<p class="calibre1">1 Improved Ability (Close Combat) qi focus is a Force 4 focus (since it costs 1 Power Points per level), while a Combat Sense focus is Force 2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spell Foci Spell foci empower Sorcery. Each spell focus is attuned to rituals or to one of the five categories of spells (Combat, Detection, Illusion, Healing, and Manipulation) when it is created, and that category cannot be changed. There are four types of spell foci. Counterspelling: Counterspelling foci add dice equal to their Force to any Counterspelling at- tempt, as long as the countered spell is in the same category as the focus. It also adds its Force as a dice pool bonus when you perform the Boosted Defense form of counterspelling (p.&nbsp;143). Ritual Spellcasting: A ritual spellcasting focus adds its Force in dice to your Ritual Spellcasting Tests (whether you’re the leader or a participant). If the ritual isn’t a spell ritual, this focus can still be used, but if it’s a spell ritual of a different category than the focus, it can’t. Spellcasting: Spellcasting foci add their Force to your Spellcasting dice pool as long as the spell is in the same category as the focus. Sustaining: When you cast a spell through a sus- taining focus, it sustains the spell for you, letting you avoid the dice pool penalty for sustaining a spell. A spell sustained by a sustaining focus can- not have a modified Drain Value (after adding any effects) greater than the Force of the focus, and the spell’s category must match the focus’s category. If a spell sustained by a focus is disrupted, it ends, but the focus is still active (and still bound to its owner), it’s just not sustaining a spell at the moment. A sus- taining focus can’t be used to sustain a spell ritual.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit Foci Spirit foci empower a magician’s conjuring skills. Each spirit focus must be attuned to a spe- cific type of spirit. Summoning: A summoning focus adds dice equal to its Force to summoning attempts as long as the targeted spirit is in the same category as the focus. Banishing: The banishing focus gives the char- acter a point of Edge if its Force is higher than the spirit’s Force. That point must be used on the Banishing test or it is lost.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weapon Foci A weapon focus always has, unsurprisingly, the form of a melee weapon (it cannot be a ranged weapon). It adds magical power to the melee at- tacks you make with it. When used in physical combat, it gives you its Force as a dice-pool bonus on your Attack test. You still rely on your physical attributes and skills in combat; the weapon focus merely makes you more effective.</p>
<p class="calibre1">155</p>
<p class="calibre1">FOCI // MAGIC</p>
<p class="calibre1">156</p>
<p class="calibre1">A weapon focus is effective against astral forms too, whether you’re using astral perception or pro- jection. It adds its Force to your Astral Combat tests when you’re using it, and you can take it along while astrally projecting. The damage of the weap- on in astral combat is the same as it is in the physi- cal world, except that you can decide between Stun or Physical damage (Astral Combat, p.&nbsp;160).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Adepts Adepts channel mana in a different way from spellcasters. Rather than use formulae to shape mana into an external spell effect, adepts take mana into themselves, letting it flow through- out their body and enhance their abilities. It may make them stronger, faster, healthier, more charming, or some other effect, but however it works, it makes them tremendously effective shadowrunners. Adepts sometimes have to resist drain, which they do with Body + Willpower. Drain is Stun un- less the damage after the resistance test is higher than the caster’s Magic, in which case the damage is Physical.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Power Points The key measurements of power in adepts are their power points. These points are used by ad- ept characters to buy the powers that will enhance their abilities. Whenever adept characters gain a point of Magic, they also gain a power point. This means that an adept character who starts with a Magic rating of 4 also starts with 4 power points. Power points do not need to be spent when they are obtained; characters can hold on to them and use them when ready.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Adept Powers These are the powers adepts can use to give them the boost they need. The listings include the power point cost and the type of action needed to activate the power. Some adept powers have levels, meaning their effect can be increased as multiple levels are purchased. Others are a flat bonus&mdash;you buy them once, and you have the full thing!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Adrenaline Boost Cost: 0.25 PP per level Activation: Minor Action You get a surge of energy so you can get the jump on others. For each level of the power, add 2 to your initiative score for (Magic) combat rounds. At the the end of those combat rounds, experience drain equal to the level of the power, which you can resist as normal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Astral Perception Cost: 1 PP Activation: Minor Action You gain the ability to astrally perceive and fol- low the rules involved in so doing (see p.&nbsp;159). You are dual-natured while using this power and can attack astral forms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Attribute Boost (Attribute) Cost: 0.25 PP per level Activation: Major Action Mana flows into your body and enhances your inherent abilities, carrying you to a superior level. When purchasing this ability, it must be applied to a specific Physical attribute (Body, Agility, Reac- tion, or Strength); if this power is purchased multi- ple times, it can be used to either increase the rank connected to an already-selected attribute (up to 6) or to apply to a new attribute. It cannot be applied to Mental or Special attributes. When this power is activated, roll Magic + At- tribute Boost rating. Each hit temporarily boosts the rating of the designated attribute by 1, up to the augmented maximum of +4. This only affects dice pools, so your Initiative rank, Condition Monitor, Defense Rating, and so forth is not changed. The effect lasts for (net hits) combat rounds, and when it runs out, the adept takes drain equal to the level of this power, resisted as normal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Combat Sense Cost: 0.5 PP per level Activation: Passive This power gives you the ability to anticipate and avoid harm. Gain a +1 dice pool bonus per level on any defensive tests. You always have a chance to make a Perception test to avoid surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Critical Strike Cost: 1.0 PP per level Activation: Passive Increase the DV of your melee attacks by 1 per level of this power. This power is compatible with other enhancements from weapons and ad- ept powers unless otherwise prohibited.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Danger Sense Cost: 0.5 PP Activation: Passive You have a sixth sense for danger, instinctive- ly knowing when it’s nearby and preparing for it. Gain an Edge before making Surprise tests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Direction Sense Cost: 0.25 PP Activation: Passive</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC // ADEPTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">You have a good sense of where you have been, where you’re going, and a few of the obstacles in between. When making an Outdoors test related to directions, you may gain an Edge point, provid- ed you spend it immediately on that test.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enhanced Perception Cost: 0.5 PP Activation: Passive Your senses are keenly honed, giving you infor- mation in enough time for you to figure out what to do about it. Gain an Edge when Observing in Detail or making a Perception test to find some- thing hidden or listen to something you’re not sup- posed to hear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enhanced Accuracy Cost: 0.5 PP Activation: Passive Weapons are more accurate and deadly in your hands than in those of normal people. Increase the Attack Rating of any weapon you wield by 2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Improved Ability (Skill) Cost: Combat skill: 1.0 PP per level; other skills 0.5 PP per level Activation: Passive A skill must be selected when this power is chosen. That skill receives an ongoing boost equal to the rating of the power. The maximum boost to the skill is 1.5 times the current lev- el (rounded up) or the augmented maximum, whichever is lower. You need to have at least one rank in a skill to buy this power for it, and the power can be purchased for multiple skills.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Improved Physical Attribute Cost: 1 PP per level Activation: Passive Select a Physical attribute (Body, Agility, Reac- tion, or Strength) when purchasing this skill. That attribute receives an ongoing boost equal to the level of this power. The maximum boost to the at- tribute is 1.5 times the current level or the aug- mented maximum, whichever is lower.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Improved Reflexes Cost: 1 PP per level Activation: Passive This power gives you quick reflexes and antic- ipation, allowing you to act and react much fast- er than the normies. For each level of this power, add an Initiative Die and increase your Reaction by 1. The maximum level of this power is 4, and it cannot be combined with any other Initiative or Reaction boosts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Improved Sense Cost: 0.25 PP Activation: Passive When this power is purchased, select a sense (sight, hearing, touch, taste, or smell). When mak- ing a test involving that sense, you get a bonus Edge, but only if you use it (either alone or in com- bination with other Edge points) on that test. Edge points from this power cannot be gained more than once when the same sense (noise, sight, flavor, etc.) is involved. This power can be selected more than once, each time for a different sense.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Killing Hands Cost: 0.5 PP Activation: Minor Action Your hands become lethal and magical, useful both in shadowrunning and cheesy pickup lines. When fighting unarmed, you can choose to deal Stun or Physical damage. Killing Hands can be combined with other powers affecting unarmed combat. At- tacks made with Killing Hands are considered magi- cal, meaning they bypass protections against normal weapons and can be made against astral beings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kinesics Cost: 0.25 PP Activation: Passive Your command of body language and nonver- bal communication is, well, magical, and it helps you be incredibly difficult to read. When you are resisting Social tests and tests to read your emo- tions, judge your intentions, or gauge your truth- fulness, you gain an Edge point. Only one such Edge point can be gained per encounter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mystic Armor Cost: 0.25 PP per level Activation: Passive Mana forms a shield around you, enhancing your protection. Gain 1 point of Armor for each level of this power, cumulative with worn Armor, which also increases your Defense Rating. Mystic Armor is also active on the astral plane.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pain Resistance Cost: 0.25 PP per level Activation: Passive Pain hurts, but you gain an elevated ability to ignore it. For each level of this power, the negative modifiers from damage move one box farther down the Condition Monitor&mdash;for example, at level 1, you don’t suffer the &ndash;1 penalty until 4 boxes are filled on a Condition Monitor, rather than 3. It works for both Stun and Physical Condition Monitors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">157</p>
<p class="calibre1">ADEPTS // MAGIC</p>
<p class="calibre1">158</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rapid Healing Cost: 0.5 PP per level Activation: Passive The magic that flows through you helps knit your bones and regrow your flesh, making you heal quickly. Add one hit per level on Healing tests performed to heal you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spell Resistance Cost: 0.5 PP Activation: Passive Spells have a tendency to bounce off you rather than affect you. Gain a point of Edge when target- ed by spells.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Traceless Walk Cost: 0.5 PP Activation: Passive You don’t disturb the dust, dirt, snow, water, or anything else under your feet as you move, so there is no evidence of your passing. You don’t trigger tripwires, pressure pads, or other traps based on leg movement. Hearing tests to listen for your pas- sage and Outdoors tests to perceive your tracks cannot gain or spend Edge.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vocal Control Cost: 0.5 PP Activation: Passive You can control the pitch and modulation of your voice to make it sound the way you want&mdash; loud, quiet, resonant, or like some person you want to imitate. Gain Edge when attempting a Con or Influence test that somehow involves your voice. Only one point of Edge may be earned per encounter with this power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wall Running Cost: 0.5 PP Activation: Minor Action Running horizontally is so pedestrian (get it?). Running up a wall is how you show you’re special. When using this power, you can use a Sprint action (see p.&nbsp;44) to run up a vertical surface. You cannot use this power for two actions in a row; you have to spend at least one turn moving across a hori- zontal surface before using this power again. So if you run up a wall and don’t find a good foot or handhold, you’ll be falling right back down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mystic Adepts With a foot in two different kinds of magic, mystic adepts can be devastatingly powerful. Their ability to use both spells and adept powers gives them tremendous flexibility. They might not sling spells as well as a full magician or gain the full physical powers of a dedicated adept, but the way they combine those abilities can make them le- thal&mdash;and valuable. At character creation, mystic adepts divide their Magic rating between spells and power points. They get 1 power point for each point of Magic dedicated to the adept side, and spells equal to the amount of Magic dedicated to being a mage x 2. Mystic adepts cannot be aspected spellcasters. They can only perceive astrally if they purchase the Astral Perception adept quality, and they can never astrally project.</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC // MYSTIC ADEPTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aspected Magicians Aspected magicians do not have the range of powers that full magicians do. Instead, they are limited to a specific magical skill set. Rather than being their primary tool in running the shadows, it complements other skill sets they build up. At character creation, aspected magicians choose a single magical skill&mdash;Sorcery, Conjuring, or Enchanting. That is the only magical skill they can have, and they can never acquire ranks in the other skills in any other way. Aspected magicians can astrally perceive and astrally project. They also can follow mentor spir- its (see p.&nbsp;162).</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Astral Plane There is a reality that is with us all the time, but most of us only have a distant impression of its ex- istence. We feel its movements as the distant mem- ory of a breeze, or a snatch of a forgotten tune. If we reach out to grab it and make it concrete, it wriggles away from us. This lack of clarity, though, does not prevent us from knowing it is there. This other reality is the astral plane. It overlaps our plane and is in some ways a reverse mirror of it, so that the people and places that dominate our reality fade to dim shadows, and the shape of magic and life that may be vague impressions jump to startlingly colorful life. The astral plane is the reason people make a connection between life and magic, because those are the two things that show up there. Everything living has an astral aura, a dance of light and col- or that reflects the nature and disposition of the life form. Experienced astral viewers learn how to glean information from these shapes, determine things such as the relative power of the being, their mood, and whether any magical effects are active on them (see Assensing, right column). Spells glow brightly on the astral when cast (unless hidden through metamagic; see p.&nbsp;167), and the impres- sion fades slowly after the spell is dismissed, pro- viding evidence for astral detectives. With train- ing, some magicians learn how to remove their astral essence from their bodies, streaking across the world at high speeds and gaining entrance to places that might otherwise be forbidden them (see Astral Projection, p.&nbsp;160). Traveling in the astral presents the opportunity of encountering other astral beings, and where such an opportunity ex- ists, there is also an opportunity for conflict. Astral Combat (p.&nbsp;160) covers how this works. While magicians and adepts use Astral Percep- tion, they become dual-natured and suffer a &ndash;2 dice pool penalty to all non-Magic actions.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Assensing Assensing is the art of gaining information from astral forms, peering at the shifting colors and lights to decode patterns and glean meaning. Characters need some way to astrally perceive in order to use this ability, meaning they need to be a magician, aspected magician, or adept or mystic adept with the Astral Perception power. Assensing uses the Astral skill combined with Intuition. Tests can be made untrained if the char- acter would be able to astrally perceive but does not have ranks in the skill by following the un- trained skill test rules (p.&nbsp;93). Assensing tests can be made at any point when a character can see the astral plane, meaning when they are astrally per- ceiving or astrally projecting. Assensing works similar to Detection spells (p. 134) in terms of the information it provides. Play- ers looking at a particular aura roll an Astral + Intuition test; the number of hits they get deter- mines the amount of information they glean from the aura (see Assensing Table).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Astral Signatures Assensing the auras of cast spells can be an im- portant information-gathering technique. Every Awakened person has an astral signature, and it can be seen in the spells they cast, the items they enchant and/or use, and the rituals they perform. That means the traces individuals leave in the as-</p>
<p class="calibre1">159</p>
<p class="calibre1">ASPECTED MAGICIANS // MAGIC</p>

<p class="calibre1">tral may be traced back to them by careful observ- ers. Some of these fade over time&mdash;the astral glow from spells lasts for a number of hours equal to the Magic rating of the caster. Conscientious cast- ers can clean up behind them through the Cleanse Major Action. When choosing this action, the play- er scrubs traces of a single spell or other magical effect from the astral plane. Each Cleanse action taken acts like an hour of time passing in terms of aura fading. Characters may take this action as many times as they want until the signature is en- tirely removed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Astral Projection Scanning the astral plane is the first step in interacting with it; the next step is diving into it. Astral projection is the art of removing your consciousness&mdash;your soul, your essence, your ego, your spirit, whatever you want to call it (we’ll just call it your astral form)&mdash;from your physi- cal body. You dwell in the realm of drab earth and spectacular auras, where spells, spirits, and Awakened people spark like fantastic fireworks. There are a few rules and guidelines to remember when traveling astrally: 1. It’s fast. The astral plane has no actual physical component, and when you are out of your body, you are a creature of pure thought. There are no physical restraints containing your speed. You can move in a blur (astrally running), at a rate of 5 kilo- meters per combat round, which does not allow you to see anything you are whizzing past. Or you can slow it down to an astral walk, moving at 100 meters per combat round, which allows you to take in in the surroundings you pass.</p>
<p class="calibre1">astral homecoming Although your body won’t move itself while you’re as- trally projecting, it still might be moved&mdash;after all, your team can’t always just sit in one place while you’re out and about. Alternately, someone might move your body against your will while you’re out. When that happens, how do you find your way back? Fortunately, Awakened individuals often have some sense of where their body is. Unfortunately, it’s not perfect. If a character attempts to return to a body that is in a location unknown to them, they should make an Astral + Intuition test. The threshold is determined by the gamemaster based on how far the body is moved, how well hidden it might be, and other circumstances. Success on the test means the character can find their body in 1 hour. For each net hit beyond the initial success, the time to find their body is cut in half (so with one net hit, it takes a half hour; with two, fifteen minutes; with three, seven and a half minutes; and so on).</p>
<ol start="2" class="calibre2">
<li class="calibre3">It’s ghostly&mdash;mostly. Buildings, vehicles, and pretty much anything else manufactured by metahuman hands has nothing more than a vague grey presence on the astral, and astral travelers can pass through it all with ease. Other astral beings can slow you down, and the earth is impenetrable by astral forms (want a secure research facility? Build it un- derground). Beyond that? Fly like the wind!</li>
<li class="calibre3">Physical details are hard to come by. Build- ing on the previous rule, since the things of the world are so ghostly in the astral, don’t count on getting any important details, like reading text or seeing what objects are spread out on a desk. Getting the loose de- tails of a building’s layout may be possible, but knowing the purpose of the rooms you see might depend on guessing as much as anything else.</li>
<li class="calibre3">You can be a ghost! Yes! You can attempt to manifest your form in the material realm so that people there can see you, albeit in faint and faded fashion. Manifesting is a Major Action; making your manifestation vanish requires the same Major Action. A manifest- ing astral projection has no physical pres- ence, meaning they cannot interact with the physical world, and they are not captured on any recording equipment. You also cannot cast spells at targets solely on the physical plane, but you can communicate with the people in the vicinity as if you were there.</li>
<li class="calibre3">Astral curfew is real. You can’t stay away from your physical body forever. You can stay away from your body for (your Magic rating x 2) hours. If you stay out too long, re- duce your Essence by 1 for each hour you’re out (it will recover 1 point per hour upon your return). If it hits zero, oops, you’re dead. Your physical body dies, and your as- tral form vanishes in a puff of astral smoke. So if you’re away from your body, keep an eye on the time. And make sure no one takes your body while you’re out and hides it or something (see Astral Homecoming sidebar).</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre1">Astral Combat Wandering the astral plane is great for recon, but it’s not all about flitting around at the speed of thought and checking out auras. There are hostile forces out there, including other astrally projecting magicians, and sometimes you have to deal with them. Astral combat works the same as other types of combat, in that you need an Attack Rating, a Defense Rating, dice pools for attacking, and dice pools for defending. As is the case with spellcast-</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC // THE ASTRAL PLANE</p>
<p class="calibre1">ing, your Attack Rating is your Magic rating plus your tradition attribute (Logic for hermetic mages, Charisma for shamans). Your physical body is not involved in astral combat, so your Defense Rat- ing does not involve physical armor or your Body attribute; instead, it’s Intuition + innate armor + armor effects (such as the Mystic Armor spell, p.&nbsp;141). Metahumans do not have innate armor to their astral form, since that’s why they have a physical body&mdash;to protect the astral form they carry around with them. Some astral beings have more built-in protection. Astral combat can happen in three basic ways. One is through spellslinging, and that works the same way as it does in the material plane, except that you can only use Mana spells. The second is through unarmed combat. In this case, use Astral + Willpower vs.&nbsp;Intuition + Log- ic of the defender. The base Damage Value of any unarmed astral attacks is your (tradition attribute / 2, rounded up). Net hits add 1 per hit to the base damage. The third way to attack is with a weapon focus. You still use your Close Combat skill, but Will- power is substituted for Agility (since your physi- cal skills don’t come into play). Roll Close Combat + Willpower vs.&nbsp;Intuition + Logic. The damage is the same as the weapon’s physical version, and net hits still add 1 to the base damage. Since weapon foci have to be melee weapons, there are no ranged attacks with weapons in astral combat. If you want to attack at range, you have to use a spell. If a hit is successful, astral characters roll Will- power as their Damage Resistance test. The attacker can choose if the damage is Physical or Stun. Mana barriers can only be damaged by Physical damage. The Astral Combat table summarizes all the skills and attributes used in astral combat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Astral Tracking Nearly all magical things (spirits, spells, foci, and magical lodges) have an astral link to whoever was responsible for them. Active spells are linked to their casters, spirits are linked to their summon- ers, astrally projecting magicians are linked to their physical bodies, and foci and magical lodges are linked to the magicians who activated them. Awakened entities who assense the astral signature of these astral forms can track their links through the astral plane back to their sources. Following an astral link requires an Astral + Intuition (5, 1 hour) Extended test modified as noted on the As- tral Tracking Modifiers table.</p>

<p class="calibre1">can be on the physical or astral planes, but some are dual-natured barriers that exist on both. The Mana Barriers table lists the different ways to cre- ate a mana barrier using rules in this book. Mana barriers on the physical plane are invis- ible (except to astral perception), but they act as solid barriers to spells, manifesting entities, du- al-natured entities, spirits, and active foci. Any- body trying to cast a spell through a barrier must contend with the rating of the barrier, which is added to the defense dice pool. If the spell doesn’t normally have an opposed dice pool, the Spellcast- ing test becomes an Opposed test against (rating of the barrier x 2). Mana barriers on the astral plane are solid, haz- ily opaque walls. Such barriers stop astral move- ment and impose a visual penalty equal to the bar- rier’s Force. Astral mana barriers are resistant to astral spells as well as other astral forms, in the same manner as physical mana barriers. Dual-natured mana barriers are active on both planes simultaneously, and they act like mana bar- riers on both planes at once. Adept powers and many always-on critter pow- ers are innate and so are unaffected by a barrier. The gamemaster has the option to have certain ranged and sustained critter powers (such as Concealment or Movement) suffer the same fate as spells. Mana barriers do not affect their creators, who can see through them or pass through them at will and allow others to do so as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">161</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE ASTRAL PLANE // MAGIC</p>
<p class="calibre1">162</p>
<p class="calibre1">An item normally blocked by a mana barrier might run into one by being in an elevator, van, or something else that is unknowingly crossing a barrier. In these cases, roll an Opposed test; liv- ing beings roll Magic + Charisma, foci roll Force x 2, preparations roll Potency x 2, barriers roll Structure rating x 2, spells roll caster’s Magic x 2. Whatever side loses is disrupted&ndash;spells dissipate, foci deactivate, spirits return to their home meta- plane, and living beings are knocked unconscious with a full Stun Condition Monitor. In cases of a tie, everything disrupts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting Around Mana Barriers If you’ve got a mana barrier in your way, you can move around it or push through it. Or go home, but that’s not likely to get you paid. If you want to break through a mana barrier, you need to deal with its Structure rating, just as you would with any other barrier. A mana bar- rier has Structure rating generated at its creation (usually tied to hits on spellcasting tests). Break it quickly, because they regain their full rating at the end of every combat round. The creator of a mana barrier is instantly aware of any attack on the barrier. Awakened characters have discovered other methods of forcing their way through an astral bar- rier besides using brute force. You can press through a barrier with a Magic + Charisma vs.&nbsp;Structure rat- ing x 2 Opposed test. If you get any net hits, you pass through the barrier and emerge on the other side. You can bring a number of friends, spirits, ac- tive foci, sustained spells, or other astral forms with you, one for each net hit you score. If the barrier scores more hits, you fail to break through. The cre- ator of a mana barrier is not aware of successful ef- forts to push through, but becomes instantly aware of any failed attempt as if it were an attack on the barrier.</p>

<p class="calibre1">to help you out, someone who can not only teach you how to use magic, but who can help fit mag- ic into some sort of code, giving meaning to the power you possess. Awakened individuals often turn to mentor spirits for this purpose. Mentor spirits often have deep roots in the mythology and traditions of many cultures, and they have shaped (and been shaped by) these cultures. Ever since the Awaken- ing, they have become something more than belief, helping shape and channel the magic of the people who follow them. This mentor spirit is much like other spirits in that it has its own personality, but it’s not a spirit in the summon-and-banish sense of the term. It can be seen and heard by those it chooses, and it can even physically interact with its followers. A per- son’s mentor spirit can have significant influence over them, offering benefits when they remain true or punishing them if they go astray (usually with temporary reductions to their Magic rating). Magical mentorship can come in different forms. Often individuals have their own link to their mentor spirit, but an Awakened guild or society can become linked to a mentor spirit as a group. There is no real understanding of the nature of mentor spirits, but their general goal is clear: They want to keep Awakened individuals on the path that helped shape and give reality to the mentor spirit in the first place. For gamemasters, mentor spirits can be used as a tool to commu- nicate information to the magician and enhance role-playing. The mentor spirit can provide cryp- tic clues, riddles, omens, and sometimes even straightforward advice. Any Awakened character can connect with a mentor spirit by taking the Mentor Spirit quality (p.&nbsp;73). Gamemasters may also choose to award mentor spirits in the course of role-playing, provided the player character has done enough to deserve it.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Initiation As Awakened individuals practice their craft, they not only become more proficient at the basic skills of magic, but they also build a deeper com- munion with the ways of magic so that they can ascend to new levels of power. This growth does not just happen&mdash;rather, it is the result of a dedicated process, an act of medi-</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAGIC // INITIATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">tation and concentration that builds new strength inside you. This process is known as initiation. Initiation takes many forms. It might mean im- mersing yourself in old and dusty texts, the kinds that you can’t find in the Matrix. It may mean a vision quest, where you commune with a mentor spirit in order to gain guidance and instruction. It could even involve excruciation, purifying your concentration and discipline through pain. Whatever the process is, it requires time and Karma but results in significant benefits. The first time you initiate, you receive an Initiate Grade stat that is set, reasonably enough, at 1. It increases by 1 each time you initiate in the future. Your Initi- ate Grade can never exceed your Magic rating. If something happens to your Magic rating so that it is lower than your Initiate Grade, then your Initi- ate Grade automatically decreases to equal your Magic, and you lose any associated bonuses. To start initiation, make a [highest Magic skill] + Magic (desired Initiate Grade) Extended test, with an interval of one month and spend (10 + desired Initiate Grade) Karma. Once the threshold has been reached and the Extended test interval is complete, you gain the benefits of initiation, as follows:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Your maximum Magic rank increases. Your maximum Magic rank is 6 + Initiate Grade, so ini- tiation means you have the potential to make it higher. Note that the Magic rank does not increase automatically at initiation&mdash;you still must spend Karma to increase it. You gain access to the metaplanes. When you reach Initiate Grade 1, you gain the ability to visit other metaplanes if you can astrally project. Meta- planes are the homes of spirits and follow the same general characteristics as their residents. You learn a metamagic. Metamagics are spe- cial processes that enhance the way you interact with magic. Unless otherwise noted, metamagics can only be selected once. Some are designated as being for adepts only, and some would be of very little use to adepts, so choose carefully!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Metamagics Below is a selection of metamagics Awakened characters can select during initiation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Adept Centering (Adepts Only) Adept centering allows you to overcome possi- ble negatives from adverse conditions, such as poor lighting, challenging environment, or even swirling illusions. By performing a centering action, you retain your focus so that your opponents cannot take advantage of you. When acting against you, opponents cannot gain Edge from advantages due to environmental conditions, or from changes in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Attack or Defense Ratings tied to Illusion spells on your turn when you perform a centering action, or their next turn after the action was performed. The centering action can be simple, but it should be obvious to anyone who is paying attention. May- be it’s singing, chanting, making ritualistic hand gestures, whatever. As long as it aligns mind with body, it’s good. Performing your centering action requires a Minor Action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Centering A magician who learns to center has an easier time resisting drain. By using a mundane activity appropriate to your tradition to quiet your mind and block out distractions, you add a number of dice equal to your Initiate Grade to all your Drain Resistance tests. Centering is a Minor Action. The actual activity you use to center is something you choose for yourself (appropriate to your tradition, of course), and it could be something like chant- ing in Latin, playing a musical instrument, danc- ing, singing, making arcane gestures, screaming the names of ancient gods&mdash;just about anything that isn’t subtle. If you’re prevented from performing your centering technique of choice (for example, you are manacled and can’t make hand gestures), you can’t use this metamagic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fixation You magically infuse an alchemical preparation with Karma, extending its shelf life. When you cre- ate the preparation, spend at least 1 Karma (up to the Potency of the preparation). When the prepa- ration’s Potency starts to decay, instead of losing 1 Potency every [current Potency x 2] hours it loses 1 every day. It also gets a dice pool bonus against Disjoining (p.&nbsp;153) equal to the amount of Karma you spent on it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Flexible Signature You can alter your astral signature (p.&nbsp;159) at will. You can disguise your aura so that it can’t be used to identify you, or you can forge the astral signature of another magician you’ve assensed, or simply reduce the amount of time your astral sig- nature lasts. When someone attempts to assense your faked signature, add your Initiate Grade to the Assensing test threshold&mdash;if a Grade 2 initiate leaves a forged astral signature, another magician could read the signature with 3 hits as usual, but at 5 hits would realize the signature is fake and spot the true signature underneath. You can only forge astral signatures you’ve read through assensing (your gamemaster may ask for a Memory test&mdash; see p.&nbsp;67). You can also reduce the longevity of the astral signatures you leave behind by your grade in hours.</p>
<p class="calibre1">167</p>
<p class="calibre1">INITIATION // MAGIC</p>
<p class="calibre1">168</p>
<p class="calibre1">Masking You learn to change the appearance of your aura (and astral form). You can make it look mundane or make your Magic rank look higher or lower by up to your Initiate Grade. When someone tries to read your masked aura, the Assensing test becomes opposed by your Magic + Initiate Grade&mdash;if they get any net hits, they see both your mask and your real aura. If you can use astral perception, you can even make your aura look like a different type (like a spirit or a focus&mdash;great for astral costume parties). You can also use this metamagic to mask the auras or a number of bonded foci equal your Initiate Grade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Power Point (Adepts Only) If you’re an adept, you can gain a Power Point instead of a metamagic. You can take this as many times as you like.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Quickening You can manipulate your sustained spells into a sort of loop, so that they sustain themselves in- stead of relying on you to do it for them. To quick- en a spell, take a Major Action and spend Karma while you’re sustaining the spell. You must spend at least 1 Karma but may spend up to the num- ber of hits on the Spellcasting test that generated</p>
<p class="calibre1">spell. The spell becomes permanent and gets a dice pool bonus against dispelling (p.&nbsp;143) equal to the amount of Karma you spent on it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spell Shaping You can reshape your area spells at the cost of making casting them harder. For every &ndash;1 dice pool penalty you take to your Spellcasting test, you may either increase an area spell’s radius by 1 meter, decrease it by 1 meter, or create a one-meter-radi- us spherical “bubble” within the area of your spell that remains unaffected by it (note that some crea- tures and metatypes need a larger protective bub- ble than others). You must declare the use of this metamagic when you cast the area spell. You may not take more dice worth of penalty than your Magic rank. Unlike the Increase Area effect, this has no effect on the spell’s Drain Value.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shielding A character with the shielding metamagic learns to better protect themself and others against hostile spells as they are cast. When the magician declares Boosted Defense (p.&nbsp;143), they can add additional dice directly to the spell defense pool equal to their Initiate Grade. These additional dice cannot be used for any other use of Counterspell- ing, including dispelling.</p>

<p class="calibre1">In the Sixth World, information is power. Nowhere is this more true than on the Matrix. It is ubiquitous, connecting everything from office workstations to home-automation systems. From bleeding-edge advanced prototypes to ten-year-old burner commlinks, the Matrix is everywhere. Technically speaking, the Matrix is the inter- connection of all worldwide devices, wireless or otherwise, that use the same protocols and meth- ods for communication. In a more abstract sense, the Matrix is a vast shared virtual space, home to the entirety of metahuman knowledge, with a fair bit of imagination and outright lies mixed in. Everyday users access the Matrix for many tasks in the course of their day, searching for trideos of cats, answering phone calls, remotely turning on their car, controlling a logging drone, or monitor- ing cameras, among other things. Hackers, on the other hand, make the Matrix do what they want, legally or otherwise. Some, called deckers after the equipment they use, do it with high-tech devices called cyberdecks. Oth-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ers, called technomancers, manipulate the Matrix through sheer force of will. These digital rogues have no use for the normal, regulated channels, in- stead working their virtual magic in ways a normal user could never dream about. Matrix-based devices and defenses are so com- mon that a character competent in using or bypassing such things is integral to any runner team. Hackers earn their pay disabling alarms and auto-defenses, scrambling enemy communications, and destroying anything that connects to the Matrix. They act as the team’s communications hub, safeguarding them from virtual attack. They’re also the go-to specialists when it comes to digging out information, either in a general search or a quest for specific piece of data they can fence or ransom for cash.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matrix History The Matrix, as we know it in the Sixth World, is the third iteration of what used to be called the in-</p>
<p class="calibre1">MATRIX // MATRIX HISTORY</p>
<p class="calibre1">ternet or World Wide Web. Around the turn of the millennium, it took off and grew incredibly fast, adding new technologies for enhanced stability and speed at an almost daily rate. Then, in 2029, things took a turn for the worse. A fast-moving and destructive virus unlike any- thing the world had seen began taking down large swaths of network infrastructure, destroying soft- ware and hardware alike. The United States orga- nized an elite squad of hackers, technicians, and network wizards and equipped them with newly developed techniques for direct neural interface, then sent them against the virus. Echo Mirage, as the “cyber-commandos” were known, took heavy casualties as lethal biofeedback from the Crash Virus shocked and cooked their brains. Unde- terred, they pressed on, and eventually scrubbed the Virus from the network&mdash;but the damage had been done. The demise of the old internet and the Crash of ’29 gave rise to the Matrix, an advanced net- work designed to run with the human-computer interfaces used exclusively by crack teams like Echo Mirage in the past. The direct neural links that at one point required psychoactive drugs, massive amounts of cable, and a sensory-depri- vation tank to use now only took a much-smaller computer and a small piece of cyberware called a datajack. The datajack was implanted directly into a user’s head, acting as a port for a cable that would connect a computer to the metahu- man brain. As time went on, virtual space grew more and more complex, and it became commonplace for workers to spend their entire day “jacked in.” Not every technological leap forward was a boon, though. Pushing the envelope on advanced, semi-autonomous programs, Renraku stumbled into creating the first artificial intelligence. Later, born from the dissection of Renraku’s creation, another AI&mdash;one hostile to metahumanity&mdash;came into being. The shockwaves caused by this AI, in addition to a perfect storm of other factors, turned out to be too much for the Matrix. The network collapsed completely in 2064, an event now known as the Second Crash (or Crash 2.0). Out of the ashes of the old Matrix came the Matrix as we know it today. It is primarily a wire- less network, and corporations have taken exten- sive steps to stop would-be hackers through the implementation of the Grid Overwatch Division. Yet, despite the chokehold corporations hold over the Matrix, its mysteries run deep. Some infra- structure is decades old, and unknown to even the savviest virtual crusaders. Even more strangely, some metahumans are able to access the Matrix without using any sort of equipment at all. In the corporations’ eyes, these technomancers are both a security threat and a valuable commodity as a new evolution of metahumanity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Matrix in Daily Life Using the Matrix is an everyday task for most of the Sixth World, though some immerse them- selves in it, allowing their perceptions to be over- ridden by simsense. Either way, to make the Ma- trix do what you want, you must first understand what you’re looking at. If you’re interacting with the Matrix through the screen of a commlink held in your hand, what you see will look vastly dif- ferent than if you were using augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR). This is the most ru- dimentary use of the Matrix, allowing for things such as commcalls, messaging, and use of basic media, including music and games. When using a commlink, various programs can help you navi- gate from place to place through voice or touch commands. Through these, you can access various hosts and interface with augmented-reality objects (AROs) nearby, allowing them to appear as a sort of pop-up window on the commlink screen. When you enter augmented reality, whether you use an implanted image link, AR-capable glasses, a datajack, or a technomancer’s innate perception, your perspective on the world around you will change dramatically. The “real world” still exists, but virtual icons interact and overlap with it. A me- chanic might use an AR display to provide a digital outline and manual for an engine to assist them with repairs. Entering a posh new restaurant, you may be greeted with a wine list and a menu, along with the day’s specials, hovering alongside you as you walk. An old warehouse can be turned into a vibrant dance club with bright icons and swirling glitter that have no physical substance. Using AR is essentially dipping a toe into the greater virtual reality of the Matrix. You can see the Matrix sprawling out around you, but real-life rules still apply. Your speed in AR is limited by how fast your body can move, and you can only see as far as you normally could, making the ab- stract infinity of the Matrix seem impossibly far away at times. Even so, this small dip into the Ma- trix can greatly alter the world around you, as ad- vertisements, virtual overlays, and the myriad of wireless devices provide stark contrast with reali- ty’s frequent dullness. To take things a step further, you’ll have to im- merse yourself in full virtual reality. In VR, the per- ceptions of the real world fall away; your conscious- ness is subsumed into the Matrix, and your senses are overridden by the ASIST (Artificial Sensory In- duction Systems Technology) interface, more com- monly known as simsense. Before you stretches an infinite black horizon, dotted with brightly colored images. These icons represent anything that can be interacted with in the Matrix. In their default mode, an icon appears as a featureless white sphere&mdash;but</p>
<p class="calibre1">171</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE MATRIX IN DAILY LIFE // MATRIX</p>
<p class="calibre1">172</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing such an icon is a rarity, thanks to the amount of customization available. Icons for parked cars look like virtual representations of what they are, and icons for individual personal area networks (PANs) are often represented by animated charac- ters, or hyper-realistic versions of their owner’s sub- jective view of perfection. Ultimately, an icon can appear in whatever way the owner chooses, with the higher-end icons being incredibly detailed and sculpted. Beyond individual PANs, huge icons loom over the virtual horizon, representing those with the most power over the Matrix, the corporations that make it run. These monumental icons are the public gateways to the individual hosts of those corpora- tions, replete with propaganda extolling the virtues of the company in glowing corporate-speak&mdash;and sometimes, coupons! Icons whose hosts are closest to your meat body appear closer, with physically far-away hosts seeming out of sight of your virtual perceptions. Of course, physics is just a suggestion within the Matrix, and traveling these distances in the blink of an eye is as simple as willing yourself to your destination. Still other icons and access points exist, so that people across the globe can log on whever they want. For all of the official control, though, there are corners of the Matrix that are still unknown. Whether these are the result of older corporate net- works hanging on as part of the new Matrix, the expansion of artificial intelligence, or the manifes- tation of the mysterious source of power that tech- nomancers call the Resonance is yet to be revealed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matrix Security: Grid Overwatch Division In the wake of the Second Crash in 2064, the new Matrix that was born from the ashes of the old one gave rise to widespread wireless technology. No longer did users have to use a cable to jack into the Matrix&mdash;now, they could wirelessly connect from anywhere they could receive a signal. The network had become such a reliable mesh that roaming be- tween grids became the norm. A hacker could con- ceivably never leave their home and still interact with (and break into) any number of devices and hosts around the world, using only their commlink. That all changed in the mid-2070s, when the Corporate Court Matrix Authority created the Grid Overwatch Division, or GOD. Initially, this organization comprised representatives of the Big Ten megacorporations who propped up the Ma- trix after the Crash, and it was tasked with keeping an eye on the emergence of artificial intelligences. Their authority was soon expanded to make them a watchdog group responsible for tracking down illegal use of the Matrix&mdash;and to help define what was and was not legal. This practice was adopted</p>
<p class="calibre1">MATRIX // THE MATRIX IN DAILY LIFE</p>
<p class="calibre1">individually by other corporations, who formed their own internal groups, colloquially known as demi-GODs. With the increase in GOD’s power, the Wild West era of the new Matrix was all but over. Still, there are those who know how to fly under the ra- dar, at least for little while, before they are caught.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elements of the Matrix These are some of the critical parts of the Ma- trix you need to understand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Digital Landscape The Matrix is its own geography, and these are some of the landmarks!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matrix Access and PANs Every Matrix service provider maintains their ways to connect users to the Matrix. Users are assigned an address based on their current loca- tion, and from there they can see what they can get into&mdash;and what walls will be put in their way. The vast majority of users know how to get on the Matrix and make it work for them, and the new structure of the Matrix means the corps don’t worry as much as they used to about throttling certain groups of users. Their security is tighter, and their consumer traps subtler. There is enough bandwidth for people to get on, and enough user data gathered to employ targeted advertising, rath- er than relying on the flood of spam that used to be common on the Matrix. Where you notice a difference in access points is the sheer sensory quality of corporate gateways. Their graphics are sharper, sounds cleaner, and smells, if you roll that way on the Matrix, more ap- petizing. The Matrix functions for all, but the peo- ple at the top of the global food chain, as is always the case, enjoy it with more luxury. They use per- sonnel, known as security spiders, to protect their Matrix investments. In recent years, Matrix access routes have merged, becoming all but indiscernible from each other in global connectedness, though there are still occasional access problems in sparse- ly populated areas. On the user side, the Matrix is built around the Personal Area Network (PAN). These are networks composed of a commlink and/or a deck, with a small number of devices slaved behind it. Generally speaking, in order to get to a device attached to a PAN, one must first gain access to that PAN. The PAN is the primary means of displaying the perso- na, or the icon of the user. Programs and devices attached to the PAN appear as smaller representa- tions of their normal icons, carried by the persona.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Icons The Matrix isn’t constrained by physical real- ity, only code. Some hardcore hackers think that code should be enough, that we shouldn’t have to prettify everything with pictures&mdash;but code is made of letters and numbers, and letters and num- bers are icons used to represent concepts. So, since it’s all iconography anyway, why not make it look nice? That’s the sentiment of the vast majority of the Matrix users, and that’s why most things you see on the Matrix are colorful, or stylish, or weird looking, or anything but boring, and not just a bunch of random alphanumeric characters. Icons are a very broad category of Matrix ob- jects. People have icons, called personas. Devices have icons. Hosts have a ton of icons, from the places they sculpt to the individual items that fill those backdrops. The software that you use has icons, and the security protocols chasing after you have icons, too. Icons generally follow guidelines to resemble the class of object they represent. Icons that represent personas (see Personas, Devices, and Attributes, be- low) are supposed to be some sort of sapient being, though that can still get pretty wild; cat-headed peo- ple, humanoid trees, and shapeshifting robots are all forms you might encounter, along with the (relative- ly rare) people who just like to look like themselves. Devices appear as inanimate objects that a sentient being might use, like a vehicle, a weapon, or even a soykaf maker. (In fact, smart soykaf makers, which learn your soykaf drinking habits and adapt so that there is always have a hot cup of ’kaf waiting for you, often have an icon in the Matrix that looks like themselves, only shinier and always clean, help- ing build the sense that online life is just like your real life, but better.) Files often resemble some sort of object that might contain data, such as a piece of paper, a book, or an old-school floppy disk or CD-ROM. Hosts and other places where people as- semble in the Matrix often look like buildings. The type of building reflects the attitude the sculptors have toward visitors, and the attitude they want visitors to have. Did they make a cozy mountain cabin with a stream flowing gently by? Then they want you to feel welcomed and comforted, possi- bly so your money will flow more freely. Did they design a massive castle with barbed wire on top of the turrets and vicious piranhas in the moat? Then they want you to know that they hate you, or at least your intrusion. Even the movement of data can be represented by icons, generally in the form of a flowing stream of images, or even just a steady wind, depending on the sculpting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nuts and Bolts That’s the landscape&mdash;now we’ll take a look at the things that fill it up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">173</p>
<p class="calibre1">ELEMENTS OF THE MATRIX // MATRIX</p>
<p class="calibre1">174</p>
<p class="calibre1">Devices Most people access the Matrix through a de- vice. Nowadays, everyone has a commlink, a pocket-sized smart device that interfaces with the Matrix at large. Some are integrated into glasses, or even fully into cybernetic augmentation, while others still have the familiar handheld screen look. They are used for rudimentary access, most commonly for commcalls and searches, as well as basic Matrix Firewall defense for devices at- tached to the user’s PAN. They also have integrat- ed cameras, music and video players, and other such features. Commlinks commonly have an ASIST module (or sim module) that enables the use of AR and cold-sim VR. Any clown with a commlink can access the ba- sic functions of the Matrix, but making it do what you want on command requires a cyberdeck. Cy- berdecks, or simply “decks,” have been redesigned in the past model year to be wearable, gauntlet-like devices. Older models incorporated a keyboard into the design, but this manual functionality has gone by the wayside in favor of AR interfaces and more complete full VR immersion. In game terms, the difference between a com- mlink and a cyberdeck is that the cyberdeck pos- sesses the Matrix Attributes needed for hacking (see Personas and Attributes, below).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Personas and Attributes Personas are the “people” of the Matrix. They’re primarily metahumans, but personas can also be programs, agents, intrusion countermeasures (IC or “ice”), and (rarely) artificial intelligences. Just like living beings in the meat world, personas have attributes and skills that determine how well they function. The skills you have in the meat world car- ry over to the Matrix, though they are not always useful (your persona may look like it’s firing a gun, but the Firearms skill is of little use in the Matrix&mdash; what looks like an attack is an action covered by another skill; see Matrix Actions, p.&nbsp;179). Attributes are somewhat different. Your Mental attributes carry over into the Matrix, but your Phys- ical attributes are replaced by four Matrix attributes: Attack, Sleaze, Data Processing, and Firewall (ASDF). • Attack represents the offensive power of the device in cybercombat and how much dam- age it can do when attacking. • Sleaze is the stealth attribute of the perso- na and represents how easy it is to hide and blend in with its surroundings, appearing as a normal icon among others, essentially dis- appearing. • Data Processing is the raw computing pow- er of a device. Data Processing governs how quickly a device can operate and contributes to running programs concurrently. The Data</p>
<p class="calibre1">Processing attribute is the limit of many de- vices you can slave to it. • Firewall is a persona’s primary defensive at- tribute. It represents how well-defended the persona is against attempts to take unautho- rized actions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you’re a decker, your Matrix attributes are determined by the device you’re using to access the Matrix. If the device doesn’t possess one or more of the Matrix attributes, then the applica- ble attribute is treated as if it were 0. You can rotate all attributes through your persona, even if they originated from different devices. Devices also have a Matrix Condition Monitor, which is equal to (Device Rating / 2, rounded up) + 8. All tests using a damaged device have a &ndash;1 modifier for every three full boxes of Matrix damage, until the device is repaired. If a device’s Matrix Condi- tion Monitor is filled up, it is bricked (see Bricked Devices, below). If you’re a technomancer, you’ll access the Matrix through your living persona instead of a device. A living persona still uses the same four Matrix attributes as a device, but their ratings are determined by your Mental attributes; see The Liv- ing Persona, p.&nbsp;189). Because they don’t use devic- es, technomancers don’t have a Matrix Condition Monitor. Any Matrix damage they take is applied to their appropriate Condition Monitor&mdash;Stun if not otherwise specified (assuming the Stun Condi- tion Monitor is not already full).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Virtual Reality Using simsense technology, users are able to ful- ly immerse themselves in the Matrix and all of its delights. Of course, this is not without risk. The faster and more intricate the experience is allowed to run, the more dangerous VR becomes. Without a filter in place, hazardous biofeedback can cause brain bleeds or worse. Still, this doesn’t stop many from taking that dive. Cold-sim virtual reality was developed as an answer to the hazards of the Matrix in full VR. It uses a simsense filter to deflect the worst of the potential biofeedback damage, but the Matrix ex- perience itself is less intense and slower. Hot-sim is virtual reality with no simsense filter. It allows much faster usage but at much greater risk. Biofeedback damage can physically hurt or even kill the user, and experiencing a virtual world that’s “more real than real” has a dangerous pull of its own. Better-than-life chips (BTLs) use sim- ilar tech to create a hyper-intense and extremely addicting experience of living someone else’s life. Hot-sim is illegal in most jurisdictions, though deckers often feel its use is necessary for the extra edge against a target.</p>
<p class="calibre1">MATRIX // ELEMENTS OF THE MATRIX</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bricked Devices A bricked device is one whose formerly complex functioning has been reduced to that of a slab of nonfunctional material. That is to say, it doesn’t work, plain and simple, since its Condition Monitor has been filled. For the most part, meat-world ob- servers of a bricked device can tell when something goes wrong&mdash;sparks, popping noises, and smoke are clear indicators of a problem. Users of a bricked device are abruptly ejected from the Matrix, and VR users have to deal with dumpshock (p.&nbsp;176). The device will not work again until it is repaired.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Repairing Matrix Damage What’s broken can often be fixed, with the prop- er tools, time, and talent. Repairing a damaged de- vice is an Engineering + Logic (number of boxes, 1 hour) Extended test. The device cannot be used while it is being repaired, and repairs cannot be per- formed without a toolkit. A critical glitch on a repair test means you messed up good&mdash;the device fails totally and will never work again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">repairing matrix damage example Glitch gets a cyberdeck from Mungo the Decker, who claims that the “magic smoke” got out of it. It isn’t quite bricked, but it’s barely a cyberdeck anymore. Glitch’s En- gineering + Logic dice pool is 12, and he gets 4 successes. This fixes 4 of the 8 boxes of Matrix Damage that Mungo’s cyberdeck had suffered.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Using the Matrix Not every use of the Matrix is about slinging code to crack an iceberg. Some folks just want to know what the score of the urban brawl match is. These people may run a simple Browse program to find what they are looking for. Other folks may just want to be left alone, making their Matrix presence all but unseen to the general user. For this section, though, we’ll mainly focus on the stuff hackers try to do while someone is trying (actively or passively) to stop them. The steps to using the Matrix are similar to the combat system:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Step by Step 1. Grab dice 2. Distribute Edge 3. Roll dice 4. Determine effect</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grab Dice When using the Matrix, all tests are Skill + At- tribute tests. These skills and attributes determine the dice pools used. Legal tests use Electronics + Logic. Illegal tests use Cracking + Logic. When a Test to perform a Matrix Action is an Opposed test, the opposing dice pool is listed in the entry for that action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Distribute Edge As is the case with physical attacks, in cyber- combat or hacking attempts, you should com- pare Attack Rating to Defense Rating. Attack Rating is the persona’s Attack + Sleaze. Defense Rating is the target’s Data Processing + Firewall. If one is four or more points higher than the oth- er, the player with the higher value gains a bonus Edge point. Some programs and modifications may grant bonus Edge or cancel Edge given to other players. As usual, no player may gain more than two bonus Edge tokens in a single round. Bonus Edge (meaning Edge above your normal Edge rating) goes away when: • You leave a host. • You reboot your device. • You jack out of the Matrix. • Your Overwatch Score (OS) climbs high enough to trigger Convergence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matrix Edge Actions Any character may use the standard Edge Boosts and Actions (see Spending Edge, p.&nbsp;46) when mak- ing Matrix-related tests. In order to use the Matrix Edge Actions listed below, you must have an im- planted cyberjack or a Resonance score.</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Emergency Boost (1 Edge): Temporarily in- crease a Matrix attribute by 1 for one test. • Hog (2 Edge): Blast a host or persona with recursive requests, eating up valuable re- sources and lowering its Data Processing by 2 and active program slots by 1 for (Attack Rating) rounds. • Signal Scream (2 Edge): The next action ig- nores any penalty from noise. • Technobabble (2 Edge): Can only be used by technomancers. Use Charisma instead of Logic on the next Matrix action. • Under the Radar (3 Edge): The next illegal action performed on this turn does not in- crease OS. That does not mean the action and any subsequent actions automatically become legal&mdash;it just means the OS does not increase.</p>
<p class="calibre1">175</p>
<p class="calibre1">USING THE MATRIX // MATRIX</p>
<p class="calibre1">176</p>
<p class="calibre1">Roll Dice Roll the dice pools and compare the hits. Who- ever ends up with more net hits wins the test, and you move on to determine the effect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Determine Effect Check the action that is being attempted, and determine the effect based on that action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Overwatch Score and Convergence When performing a Matrix action, note if it is legal or illegal. If the test is illegal, note the number of hits scored by the defender. This is not net hits, but all hits scored in the test. This total becomes the Overwatch Score (OS). When the OS reaches 40, Convergence occurs. Convergence is GOD zeroing in on your loca- tion. When this occurs, the device used to perform the last illegal test is bricked (its Condition Moni- tor is filled), and the user is dumped from the Ma- trix, with associated dumpshock (p.&nbsp;176). Addi- tionally, the user’s physical location is reported to the authorities so they might send people to track you down. Things that increase the Overwatch Score are as follows: • Using hacking programs: OS increases by 1 for each Matrix action modified by a hacking pro- gram. Simply having the program loaded with- out actively using it doesn’t increase your OS.) • Maintaining illegal access to anything on the Matrix: +1 OS/round for each host where you maintain illegal User-level access, +3 OS/round for each host where you maintain illegal Admin-level access. • Performing illegal actions (as noted above): +1 OS per hit on the opposing roll, whether the defense was successful or not.</p>
<p class="calibre1">OS and Convergence example Mungo, with his repaired cyberdeck, has spent 10 rounds within a host with illegal Admin privileges, and finally decides to check his Overwatch Score (OS). He has 30 OS from being an illegal Admin in the host, 6 OS from the Firewall of the host getting hits, and 3 OS from doing illegal actions, such as Probe to get the Admin access, Hide when the Patrol IC got too close, and his most recent Check Overwatch Score action, giving him a total of 39 OS. As Convergence happens at 40, Mun- go jacks out as soon as he can, but he doesn’t log off gracefully and suffers dumpshock (below).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumpshock and Link-Locking When you’re disconnected from the Matrix while in VR without gracefully switching to AR first, you suffer a nasty shock as your sim module kicks out. This happens to hackers so often that it has its own name: dumpshock. The Damage Value for dump- shock is 3S if you’re in cold-sim and 3P if you’re in hot-sim. Dumpshock is biofeedback damage, so you resist it with Willpower. As if that weren’t enough, you’re also disoriented and so cannot gain or use Edge on actions for (10 &ndash; Willpower) minutes, even if you manage to soak all the damage. Another danger in the Matrix is having your connection link-locked. This is when another per- sona or device sends keep-alive signals to your deck (or other device) that force it to cancel any attempt to leave the Matrix. If you’re link-locked, you can’t use the Enter/Exit Host, Reboot Device, or Switch Interface Mode actions on the device your persona is using (probably your deck). You can escape with a successful Jack Out (p.&nbsp;182) action. Successfully jacking out usually means suffering dumpshock, but at least you’re free. Any persona, be they agent, technomancer, or sprite, can be link-locked. Usually, if you fall unconscious in VR, your com- mlink or deck automatically switches you to AR. If you’re link-locked, you remain online and in VR, which can be quite dangerous. IC may attack an unconscious decker, and security spiders, being a bit smarter than IC and no less ruthless, have a lot of options to punish someone who is helpless and stuck in the Matrix. Either way, it’s nasty, since you can’t defend against actions when you’re unconscious.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Noise Noise represents any interference between a user and their target. Noise can be created by sheer distance or other factors, such as jamming or ob- structions. Each point of noise incurs a &ndash;1 penalty to any test taken in the Matrix. If noise is greater than the device rating, the device cannot access the Matrix or provide wireless bonuses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cyberjacks The emergence of technomancers gave rise to new encryption schemes used by most corpora- tions in the Matrix. To deal with these encryptions, a new type of cyberware was developed, incorpo- rating the processing power of the metahuman mind. Cyberjacks are a fairly invasive piece of gear, implanted deep into the brain, and meant to interface more smoothly with a cyberdeck. While they can act as a simple datajack, they also per- form the function of integrating the ASIST inter- face more directly, thus providing superior speed and response times.</p>

<p class="calibre1">178</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matrix Attribute Adjustments example Slamm-0! is teaching his son, Jack, how to do some low-level hacking, starting with setting his ASDF set- tings. Jack, wanting to go full-on brute force, sets his Erika MCD-6 and Transys Avalon ASDF stats to 4 3 1 3. Slamm-0!, without a hint of irony, tells his son that stealth is far superior than making noise in a system, and they correct the ASDF to 3 4 1 3, still quite offen- sive, but a touch more stealthy now.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matrix Perception Matrix Perception is how you find out what icons are near you and try to uncover ones that are trying to stay hidden. There are two ways to use Matrix Perception. One would be to use it to search the publicly available information and databases for a hit on a particular subject. This is an Extended test, Electronics + Intuition with a 10-minute interval. The other way to use Matrix Perception would be to analyze one particular icon or search for a hidden icon. This is also an Electronics + Intuition test and is opposed by the Willpower + Sleaze of the target.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Running Silent Sometimes, a user will cut off all publicly avail- able information and only respond to specific que- ries, rendering them largely invisible to the Matrix. Their wireless signal and PAN still exist&mdash;they just have to be found. A user can run silent by simply switching modes on their commlink or deck. They can be detected by an Opposed Matrix Perception test as described above. Making a Matrix Percep- tion test to find someone running silent is a typi- cally a Major Action, but if performed by a runner with a cyberdeck, cyberjack, or a Resonance attri- bute, it is a Minor Action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hacking the Matrix Historically, hacking the Matrix required a considerable financial investment in the form of a cyberdeck. The technology curve hasn’t flattened out, but over time, subversive elements have found ways to harness powerful computing using what- ever tools are at hand. This isn’t to say a good cy- berdeck isn’t worth its weight in gold, but at the end of the day, a hacker with the right skills can work wonders with even a kludged-together deck (or if they’re a technomancer, no deck at all). The first stage of hacking is gaining access to the target. There are two basic approaches to do- ing this: Brute Force, which relies on the Attack Attribute, and Probe, which relies on the Sleaze</p>
<p class="calibre1">Attribute. When you set arrange cyberdeck attri- butes, the numbers you select will help determine how well you perform certain Matrix Actions. Once you have initiated a hack, you cannot swap the base values of your Attack or Sleaze Attributes as long as you have access to the place you hacked into. Your Data Processing and Firewall attributes may be reconfigured as normal. Certain Matrix Actions and programs are linked to a particular Matrix attribute, either Attack or Sleaze. If you use an action or program that’s linked to the lower of the two attributes, like using Brute Force (an Attack-linked action) when your Sleaze is higher than your Attack, you take the difference be- tween the higher and lower Attributes as a dice pool penalty to the test required for that action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">User and Admin Access Every system in the Matrix operates on three levels of access: Outsider, User, and Admin. Out- sider access is what you have when you first log into a system, and it doesn’t grant you anything other than a look around and interaction with oth- ers in the location. User access allows you to scan information&mdash;read files, perform basic functions, that sort of thing&mdash;while Admin access allows you to change configuration, turn devices on or off, etc. Each action has a listed level of access asso- ciated with it; sometimes the gamemaster will be required to determine if a selected use of a Matrix Action falls under Outsider, User, or Admin access. Getting User or Admin access through hacking the system requires the use of the Brute Force or Probe Matrix Actions. Admin has many more privileges than User, though hacking an Admin account does not mean you are a true administrator or owner&mdash; you’re still using an illicit account.</p>
<p class="calibre1">host hacking example Jack, being watched carefully by his father, Slamm-0!, Probes the Ratt-onna-stick Matrix host in AR. He has a Crack- ing + Logic of 8 against the unmonitored host’s Firewall of 2. Jack gets lucky and gets 6 hits as he tries to make a backdoor into the system, while the Firewall gets 0 hits. This also gives an Overwatch Score of 1 to Jack, which Slamm-0! notes with his remote Baby Monitor program. Meanwhile, on the other side of Seattle, Mungo is hacking into a far harsher system, the Stuffer Shack Headquarters for all of Seattle. His cyberjack and cyber- deck ASDF are set to 3 4 3 4. He tries to Probe his way in as well, having spent all his money on repairing his deck (Glitch is not a cheap person to hire). Mungo’s Cracking + Logic dice pool is 10, while Stuffer Shack HQ has a Firewall of 3 and a security spider whose Willpower is 5, giving him a dice pool of 8. Mungo’s luck isn’t with him, and he only gets 2 hits, while the spider and Firewall get a nice 4 hits. This causes Mungo’s Overwatch Score to go to 5: 1 for the illegal action, and 4 for the number of hits by the spider. Mungo will need better luck to get himself a backdoor into this monitored system.</p>
<p class="calibre1">MATRIX // USING THE MATRIX</p>
<p class="calibre1">179</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cybercombat Cybercombat is handled much the same way as hacking is normally, except the actions taken are against another icon, such as IC or a security deck- er’s persona. Attack Rating is the persona’s Attack + Sleaze. Defense Rating is the target’s Data Pro- cessing + Firewall. In these core rules, there are two primary ways to attack a foe&mdash;Data Spike and Tarpit. Attacks are defined as actions that deal damage directly to an icon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matrix Damage Typically, Matrix damage is inflicted against the device an individual is using to access the Matrix. Devices have a Matrix Condition Monitor equal to [(Device Rating / 2) + 8]. When the device’s Matrix Condition Monitor is filled, the device is bricked (see Bricked Devices, p.&nbsp;175). Some damage, known as biofeedback damage, bypasses devices and goes straight to the user. This is referred to as biofeedback damage and is noted in relevant actions and effects. By default, Matrix damage is resisted with Fire- wall and Biofeedback damage is resisted with Will- power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matrix Initiative Matrix Initiative is handled as follows (note that the dice are in addition to the customary 1D6, and the maximum of 5D6 Initiative Dice applies): • AR Initiative: Reaction + Intuition • VR Initiative (Cold Sim): Intuition + Data Processing + 1D6 • VR Initiative (Hot Sim): Intuition + Data Processing + 2D6</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matrix Actions The title line of each action gives the name of the action, whether it is Legal or Illegal, what kind of access you need to attempt the action (either Outsider, User, or Admin), what kind of test you need to make to perform the action, and what kind of action it is (Minor or Major). Where two different dice pools are listed, such as “Intuition + Firewall or Sleaze + Firewall,” per- sonas with Mental attributes use the pool with those attributes. Drones use their Pilot Rating in place of the Mental Attribute. A persona actively defending for a device or host can use the other pool with the device or host attributes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">MATRIX ACTIONS // MATRIX</p>
<p class="calibre1">180</p>
<p class="calibre1">Backdoor Entry (illegal) Cracking + Logic vs.&nbsp;Willpower + Firewall (Major) Outsider This action is linked to the Sleaze Attribute. You attempt to use a backdoor you have put in place to gain illicit entry into a host, device, or other Matrix area. This action can only be used if you have previously used Probe on the target suc- cessfully; net hits from that successful Probe count as a dice-pool bonus on this test. If the test is suc- cessful, you gain Admin access to the target, and it does not count as illegal Admin access (though taking illegal Matrix Actions will still increase your Overwatch Score). If this test fails, the back- door you have made was detected and removed, and you cannot attempt Backdoor Entry again with the same host until a new backdoor is made through the Probe Action. Failing this test does not immediately set off alarms, but the character’s OS increases as normal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brute Force (illegal) Cracking + Logic vs.&nbsp;Willpower + Firewall (Major) Outsider/User/Admin You directly attack a device, flooding it with re- quests, commands, queries, and other junk code in order to create an exploit to give you access. Brute Force is by far the fastest way to gain illicit access to a device, but it carries with it many risks. Using Brute Force will always alert the device you are at- tempting to gain access to, so GOD score accumu- lates with each test. Should you fail a Brute Force attempt to gain access, you may attempt another on the next combat round. If the hacker is attempting to gain User access, the opposed roll is Willpower + Firewall. If the hacker is attempting to gain Admin access without first having gained User access, the opposed roll is Willpower + (Firewall + 2), and the target is grant- ed a +4 bonus to their Defense Rating for that Test. This action is linked to the Attack attribute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Change Icon (legal) No test (Minor) User/Admin You change the target’s icon to one that you have a copy of or have designed yourself. Chang- ing an icon doesn’t change the results of a Matrix Perception action but might fool personas who don’t take the time to inspect your new look. You can target your own icon, if you like.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Check OS (illegal) Cracking + Logic (4) (Major) Admin If your test is successful, you are informed of your current Overwatch Score.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Control Device (legal) Electronics + Logic vs.&nbsp;Willpower + Firewall (Major) User/Admin (can vary with action chosen) This action allows extended remote control of a device. You maintain control until you relin- quish command or are forced out of the system. While you have control, you can use the device as if you were the owner using a standard skill test, including turning the device off if you have Admin access. If there is no test associated with the device you wish to use, use Electronics + Logic vs.&nbsp;Firewall + Willpower. This test assumes you are using the device directly, not command- ing a device to use another (such as commanding a drone to fire its weapon). A Control Device action versus a device currently “jumped into” by a rigger automatically fails. When you use Control Device, you may take any action that would normally require the level of access you currently have. Hacking User access allows you to take any action that would normally require legitimate User access. Actions that nor- mally require legitimate Admin access will likewise require hacked Admin access to perform.</p>
<p class="calibre1">devices, AR, and VR The Attributes you’ll use for Control Device Tests may change based on whether you are in AR or VR while using it. If you are using a device via Augmented Reality, and the de- vice requires a Physical attribute, use your normal Physical attribute for this test. If you are using this device via Virtual Reality, and the device requires a Physical attribute, substi- tute the appropriate Mental attribute for this test. (Body = Willpower, Agility = Logic, Reaction = Intuition, Strength = Charisma).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crack File (illegal) Cracking + Logic vs.&nbsp;Encryption Rating x 2 (Major) User/Admin You remove the protection from a file, making it readable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">MATRIX // MATRIX ACTIONS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crash Program (illegal) Cracking + Logic vs.&nbsp;Data Processing + Device Rating (Major) Admin You overload part of your target’s memory and scramble one of its running programs. You need to specify which program you’re trying to crash; you can learn what your target is running either with a Matrix Perception action or by observing the program in action. If you succeed, the program is scrambled: it ends and cannot be restarted until the device it was running on is rebooted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Data Spike (illegal) Cracking + Logic vs.&nbsp;Data Processing + Firewall (Major) Outsider/User/Admin You send harmful instructions to a persona or device, causing Matrix damage to the target. Your attack has a Damage Value equal to your [Attack Rating/2, rounded up], with one additional box of damage per net hit. This action is linked to the Attack attribute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Disarm Data Bomb (legal) Cracking + Logic vs.&nbsp;Data Bomb Rating x 2 (Major) User/Admin You attempt to disarm a Data Bomb that you have detected (usually as the result of a Matrix Perception action). If you score any net hits, the Data Bomb is removed and deleted. If not, the Data Bomb activates, causing its damage and pos- sibly destroying any file to which it was attached (assuming it was set to destroy the file).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Edit File (legal) Electronics + Logic vs.&nbsp;Intuition + Firewall or Firewall + Sleaze (Major) User/Admin Edit File allows you to create, change, copy, delete, or protect any kind of file. The defender is either the host holding the file or the owner of the file (if it’s not on a host). Each action is enough to alter one detail of a file&mdash;a short paragraph of text, a single detail of an image, or two or three seconds of video or audio (you and your gamemaster can work out what exactly “one detail” means). Your gamemaster may impose penal- ties on the test if your edit is particularly intricate or tricky. If you want to perform a continuous edit, such as removing your teammates from a video feed, you need to perform this action once per combat round for</p>
<p class="calibre1">as long as you want to keep the edit going. If you use this action to copy a file, you are the new file’s owner. If the file you want to copy has protection on it, this action automatically fails. If the file has a Data Bomb, the Data Bomb goes off on you (so try to remember to scan files before you open them).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Encrypt File (legal) Electronics + Logic (Major) User/Admin The hits on the Encrypt File test establish an Encryption Rating that’s used to oppose future Crack File attempts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enter/Exit Host (legal) No test required (Minor) Depends on host settings You enter or leave a host. No test is required, but different hosts have different access levels, so you must have the appropriate access to enter. Leaving can be done without any particular access level, because the Matrix is always happy to see interlopers leave.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Erase Matrix Signature (illegal) Electronics + Logic vs.&nbsp;Willpower + Firewall or Firewall x 2 (Major) User/Admin You eradicate a Matrix signature that has been left by a Resonance being, such as a technomancer or a sprite. If the test is successful, the signature dissipates. You must have a Resonance rating to attempt this action. Unlike other actions that need Resonance, this one’s a real Matrix Action, and illegal to boot, so you risk Matrix damage and Overwatch Score when you use it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Format Device (legal) Electronics + Logic vs.&nbsp;Willpower + Firewall or Firewall x 2 (Major) Admin You rewrite the boot code of the target device. The next time it would reboot, it instead shuts down for good, or until its software can be replaced. A de- vice that has been shut down in this fashion loses all of its wireless modifiers but can still be used as a nor- mal mechanism (a door with a manual handle can be opened, a gun with a trigger can be fired, etc.), and it cannot be accessed from the Matrix. Repairing a formatted device follows the same rules as repairing a bricked device (see Bricked Devices, p.&nbsp;175), requir- ing a number of hits equal to the device’s Device Rat- ing to restore the corrupted boot code.</p>
<p class="calibre1">181</p>
<p class="calibre1">MATRIX ACTIONS // MATRIX</p>
<p class="calibre1">182</p>
<p class="calibre1">Full Matrix Defense (legal) See description (Major) Outsider/User/Admin Using Full Matrix Defense prevents you from attacking, but it makes your defense stronger. The next time you are attacked in the Matrix (meaning an action is taken that will directly cause you dam- age), add your Firewall rating to your defense roll.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hack (illegal) See Brute Force or Probe Hack (Major) Outsider/User Hacking actions are listed in this header.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hash Check (illegal) Electronics + Logic (Major) user This is a specialized Matrix search, made ille- gal by the fact that it searches for an encrypted file by matching it to a hash value (GOD does not appreciate people trying to skirt encryption). By searching for a specific value, the characters can find an encrypted document on a host or device without first having to decrypt every document to find the right one. This works best if Mr.&nbsp;Johnson provided the hash value to them, but in a pinch the search can be done with the character’s best guess. The threshold is 1 if you have a hash value from Mr.&nbsp;Johnson or some other source, 4 if you are doing the best on your own. Meeting the threshold means you have narrowed the number of possibly matching files down to 32; for every net hit, that number is divided in half (so there are 16 files with 1 net hit, 8 with 2, etc.). If the number of possible matches still seems too large after the initial test, the test can be repeated with the &ndash;2 dice pool pen- alty for repeating an action (see p.&nbsp;36). Success on this subsequent test, along with any net hits, serves to divide the number of possible matches in half.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hide (illegal) Cracking + Intuition vs.&nbsp;Intuition + Data Processing or Data Processing + Sleaze (Major) Outsider/User/Admin When you muck about in the Matrix, you’ll probably be spotted by another icon, even if you’re running silent. You can use this action to make a target lose you. If you succeed, the target stops spot- ting you and needs to perform a new Matrix Per- ception action against you if it wants to find you again. You can’t hide from an icon that has gained User or Admin access to anything in your network.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack Out (legal) Electronics + Willpower vs.&nbsp;Charisma + Data Processing or Attack + Data Processing (Major) Outsider/User/Admin This action jacks you out of the Matrix and re- boots the device you are using. You suffer dump- shock if you were in VR. The defense pool only ap- plies if you’ve been link-locked by someone; the test is against the icon that locked your link. If more than one persona has you link-locked, you need to beat each of them individually: use a single roll and com- pare your hits to rolls from each opponent who had established a link-lock. You can only jack out your- self. You can’t dump other people except by beating them into submission through Matrix damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jam Signals (illegal) Cracking + Logic (Major) Admin This action turns the wireless device you are using into a local jammer. As long as you do not use the device for any further Matrix actions, the device adds any hits you get on the test to the noise rating for all Matrix actions conducted by or tar- geting any devices within 100 meters. If you want selective jamming or directional jamming, buy a jammer&mdash;that’s what they’re for.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jump into Rigged Device (legal) Electronics + Logic vs.&nbsp;Willpower + Firewall or Firewall x 2 (Major) User/Admin You jump into a device that has a rigger adap- tation, usually a vehicle or a drone. There’s a list of things you need to have in order to jump into a de- vice: you have to have the proper access level on the device you want to jump into, you have to be in VR, the device you want to jump into has to have a rigger adaptation, and you have to have a control rig. If you are the device’s owner, or the device’s owner has giv- en you permission to jump into the device, you don’t need to make a test. In the Matrix, the icon of the de- vice you jumped into becomes part of your persona. If someone else is already jumped into the device, you cannot attempt this action until they jump out or are dumped from the interface via Matrix combat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matrix Perception (legal) Electronics + Intuition vs.&nbsp;Willpower + Sleaze (Major) Outsider/User/Admin A successful test gives you information about the</p>
<p class="calibre1">MATRIX // MATRIX ACTIONS</p>
<p class="calibre1">target. With a tie, you can perceive the item’s icon. A single net hit will give you basic information, such as device rating, or whatever name the device or icon calls itself. Two net hits will give you more specific information, including individual attribute ratings, and what programs it is currently running. Addition- al hits will give you more information based on what the gamemaster wishes to reveal. This test can also be used to attempt to find a per- sona that is running silent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matrix Search (legal) Electronics + Intuition (Extended, 10 Minutes) Outsider/User/Admin Search the publicly accessible grid for informa- tion. The number of hits generated gives you more information regarding the subject. Use the Leg- work Results table (p.&nbsp;50) as a general guideline for what is uncovered</p>
<p class="calibre1">Probe (illegal) Cracking + Logic vs Willpower + Firewall or Firewall x 2 (Extended, 1 Minute) Outsider/User/Admin You probe a device for weaknesses, looking to gain access. You take your time not to alert any security to your presence, and you can create an exploit that may last until you are ready to use it. While not as fast as using Brute Force, Probing a device does not raise an alarm automatically. Even if your attempt initially fails, it will not trigger an alarm unless major mistakes are made. Systems and devices will not detect your presence until you have gained access to them. By Probing a device, you can create a lasting backdoor to the system. Once you create the exploit, you may then use the Backdoor Entry action at a later time. Net hits on this test count as a dice pool bonus on your future Back- door Entry test. The duration of these backdoors de- pends on the device or host&mdash;generally speaking, the backdoor lasts for [10 &ndash; Host/Device Rating] hours. Most systems create a changelog and will automati- cally correct and report differences to their configu- rations caused by the presence of these exploits. This action is linked to the Sleaze attribute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reboot Device (legal) Electronics + Logic vs.&nbsp;Willpower + Firewall or Firewall x 2 (Major) Admin The target device shuts down and immediately reboots. The device comes back online at the end of the following combat round. The device ceases</p>
<p class="calibre1">electronic functions and disappears from the Ma- trix until its reboot time is over.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reconfigure Matrix Attribute (legal) No test (Minor) Admin Swap the base ratings of two attributes of your Matrix Persona, even if the numbers are rooted in different devices. See Personas and Attributes (p. 174) for more information on Matrix Attributes, and the Matrix Attribute Adjustments sidebar (p. 178) for an example.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Send Message (legal) No test (Minor) Outsider/User/Admin You send a text or audio message the length of a short sentence, an image, or a file via the Matrix to a user whose commcode you have. If you’re us- ing the Matrix through a DNI, even if you’re in AR, you can send longer and more complicated messages, about a paragraph worth of text. You can also use this action to open a live feed to one or more recipients, using any digital recording de- vices you have.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Set Data Bomb (illegal) Electronics + Logic vs.&nbsp;Device Rating x 2 (Major) Admin You set a Data Bomb in a file. Choose the rating of the Data Bomb, up to the net hits on your test. You also need to choose whether or not the Data Bomb will delete the file to which it is attached when activated, and the passcode required to de- activate it. A file can only have one Data Bomb on it at a time. The Data Bomb is triggered when someone attempts to read, edit, copy, protect, delete, or place another Data Bomb on the file without dis- arming the Data Bomb that’s already in place. When a Data Bomb goes off, it causes (Rating x 4) Matrix Damage (resisted with Willpower) to the icon that tripped it, deletes the file (if it was set that way), and then is itself deleted. If the passcode is used, the Data Bomb doesn’t ac- tivate. Instead, it remains attached to the file, waiting for the next guy. A Data Bomb can be detected using Matrix Per- ception. If it’s detected, it can be defused with the Disarm Data Bomb action; a disarmed Data Bomb is deleted.</p>

<p class="calibre1">184</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snoop (Illegal) Cracking + Logic vs.&nbsp;Logic + Fire- wall or Data Processing + Firewall (Major) Admin This action lets you intercept Matrix traffic sent to and from your target for as long as you have access. You can listen to, view, or read this data live, or you can save it for later playback/viewing if you have something to store it on (your deck or commlink will do).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spoof Command (illegal) Cracking + Logic vs Data Processing or Pilot + Firewall (Major) Outsider/User/Admin You send a signal to a device with a command the target perceives as coming from its owner. The device then automatically attempts to perform the action as its next available major action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Switch Interface Mode (legal) No test (Minor) Admin You switch your interface from AR to VR, or back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tarpit (Illegal) Cracking + Logic vs.&nbsp;Data Processing + Firewall (Major) Outside/User/Admin Sometimes you want to deliver as much hurt as possible; sometimes you want to deliver a little pain and a little slowness, in order to make the rest of your blows land easier. If you succeed in making this attack, do (1 + net hits) damage to the icon you attacked while also reducing their Data Processing rating by the same amount. If a device’s Data Processing rating is reduced to 0, the user cannot perform a Matrix action until it is 1 or more. The Data Processing rating recovers at a rate of 1 point per combat round. This action is linked to the Attack attribute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trace Icon (illegal) Electronics + Intuition vs.&nbsp;Will- power + Sleaze or Firewall + Sleaze (Major) Admin You find the physical location of a device or persona in the Matrix. After succeeding with this action, you know the target’s location for as long as you can detect the target. This doesn’t work</p>
<p class="calibre1">on IC or hosts that have no physical location, but it does work on offline hosts with physical hard- ware (although if you can access one of those to trace it, you probably know where it is already).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Programs Below are common Matrix programs, along with descriptions of the effects of the programs. The Data Processing rating of your device limits how many programs you can have running, though more may be stored.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Basic • Baby Monitor: Tells you your current Over- watch Score without needing an action. • Browse: When doing Matrix searches, gain 1 Edge that is either spent immediately on that action or disappears. • Configurator: Store alternate deck configu- ration, swap to it instead of changing two attributes. • Edit: When doing Edit File action, gain 1 Edge that must be immediately spent or else it vanishes. • Encryption: +2 dice when doing Encrypt File action. • Signal Scrubber: Reduce noise level by 2. • Toolbox: +1 to Data Processing. • Virtual Machine: 2 extra program slots; take 1 extra box of unresisted Matrix damage when attacked. Hacking • Armor: +2 to Defense Rating . • Biofeedback: Causes Stun (if target is in cold-sim) or Physical (if target is in hot-sim) damage with Matrix attack. This program is linked to the Attack attribute. • Biofeedback Filter: Allow Device Rating or Body roll to soak Matrix damage. • Blackout: Like Biofeedback, but Stun dam- age only. This program is linked to the At- tack attribute. • Decryption: +2 dice on Crack File action. • Defuse: Allow Device Rating or Body roll to soak damage from Data Bomb. • Exploit: Reduce Defense Rating of hacking target by 2. • Fork: Hit two targets with a single Matrix action without splitting dice pools. • Lockdown: Cause link-lock when you do Matrix damage. • Overclock: Add two dice to a Matrix action.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Hosts Hosts are the larger systems present on the Ma- trix. They are representative of systems that inter- connect many other systems behind them. When looking at a host from the outside, it is generally a larger icon sculpted to look like a place or a build- ing. Some hosts exist entirely virtually and appear as floating above the black plane of the Matrix, while others are attached to physical hardware at a specific location. The virtual space in a host is separate from the Matrix at large, and any icons on that host are not accessible unless expressly part of a public-facing side. Gaining access to a host will allow interaction with the icons and devices on the inside. Hosts have a general rating, which translates into their Matrix attributes. These general ratings are between 1 and 12. The ratings of these attri- butes are usually (host rating), (host rating + 1), (host rating + 2), and (host rating + 3), in any order.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, a rating 4 host might have Attack 5, Sleaze 4, Data Processing 7, Firewall 6. A host’s attributes are shared by itself and its IC programs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Host Security and Architecture Basic host security usually consists of Patrol IC scanning icons as they move about. If an unautho- rized presence is detected, it may launch other IC programs, in addition to notifying security staff that it has been compromised. A host can launch one IC program per combat round, at the begin- ning of the turn, and can have up to its rating in IC programs running at once. Hosts may only run one copy of each type of IC. Other security measures have more to do with host architecture than with killer programs. Multi- ple hosts could be nested behind one another, with the most secure data being on the deepest host. Be- cause you must hack each host in succession from the outside, having inside access to a site with a di- rect connection to the deepest host (if one exists) is valuable&mdash;especially when your Overwatch Score increases are based on all the hosts in which you maintain access at any given time, not just the one you’re currently using.</p>
<p class="calibre1">matrix host structure MATRIX HOST A HOST B HOST C HOST D</p>
<p class="calibre1">HOSTS // MATRIX</p>
<p class="calibre1">186</p>
<p class="calibre1">This basic host structure would look like this: Another could have two separate hosts for dif- ferent jobs, such as one for general office work, and another for security. Their relationship to each other might be diagrammed like this:</p>
<p class="calibre1">matrix host structure SECURITY HOST</p>
<p class="calibre1">MATRIX HOST A</p>
<p class="calibre1">OFFICE HOST</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another host could only transmit and receive data at specific times. This is more commonly used with satellite links and others where the window of opportunity for transmission is small, though it can be used to verify secure sites as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">IC These are the types of IC a host may throw at unwary intruders. All IC use (Host Rating x 2) for Attack Rating, Condition Monitor, and most rolls. Their Initiative is (Data Processing x 2) + 3D6. De- fensive rolls and effects vary by IC type. Defensive rolls and effects vary by IC type.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Acid Defense: Willpower + Firewall Acid IC is about wearing down the defenses of intruders so that the other IC can finish it off. When Acid IC hits in cybercombat, the target’s Firewall attribute is reduced by 1 per net hit, reducing the effective defenses. Lost points are restored after leaving the host, at a rate of 1 point per minute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Binder Defense: Willpower + Data Processing Where Acid IC wants to reduce your defenses, Binder IC wants to slow down all of your functional- ity&mdash;and keep you from running as many programs as you would like. When Binder IC hits in cybercom- bat, the target’s Data Processing attribute is reduced by 1 per net hit. When Data Processing hits 0, no Matrix actions can be performed until it hits 1 or higher. Lost points are restored after leaving the host, at a rate of 1 point per minute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black IC Defense: Intuition + Firewall Black IC means business. When a host tosses this out, it wants your brain fried, plain and sim-</p>
<p class="calibre1">MATRIX // HOSTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">ple. If you see this coming at you, no one would blame you for running. In cybercombat, Black IC does (host rating + net hits) in both Matrix dam- age and biofeedback damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blaster Defense: Logic + Firewall Blaster IC isn’t fun, but at least it’s not as fo- cused on killing you as Black IC is. Yeah, it might want to subject you to all sorts of unpleasant Ma- trix-based torture, but you have to be alive to ex- perience pain, so that’s something, right? In cyber- combat, this does (Rating) Matrix damage while also link-locking the target.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crash Defense: Intuition + Firewall Crash delivers a sweeping blow intended to take weapons out of your hand. When it hits in cyber- combat, this IC does no Matrix damage; instead, it crashes one random program. Crashed programs can’t be run again until the device is rebooted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jammer Defense: Willpower + Attack Jammer IC is an expert fencer who toys with you rather than killing you outright. In cyber- combat, when Jammer IC hits, the target’s Attack attribute is reduced by 1 per net hit. No actions using the Attack rating can be performed when the Attack rating is 0. Lost points are restored after leaving the host, at a rate of 1 point per minute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Killer Defense: Intuition + Firewall Killer IC is the choice of hosts where they don’t want to go for a bunch of fancy tactics and prefer to just leap for the jugular. When Killer IC hits in cybercombat, it does (net hits + host rating) Ma- trix damage to the target.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marker Defense: Willpower + Sleaze Marker IC is a response to too many back- doors&mdash;if hackers are going to start preferring Sleaze options to make and secure backdoors into hosts, then hosts are going to keep hackers from having high Sleaze ratings. In cybercombat, when Marker IC hits, the target’s Sleaze attribute is re- duced by 1 per net hit. No actions using the Sleaze rating can be performed when the Sleaze rating is 0. Lost points are restored after leaving the host, at a rate of 1 point/minute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Patrol Patrol IC is often the first line of defense in hosts, since it doesn’t escalate any confrontations, but in- stead gives the host’s owners a good sense of what’s going on. When it is activated, make a Matrix Percep- tion roll for the Patrol IC; that serves as hits on Matrix Perception actions it takes every in-game minute it is active. That means one of the Patrol IC’s Minor Ac- tions is always given over to Matrix Perception. Reroll the Matrix Perception test once per minute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scramble Defense: Willpower + Firewall Scramble IC doesn’t care how hurt or damaged you are; it just wants you gone. If Scramble IC hits in cybercombat, it forces the target to reboot on the target’s next turn, unless the target is link- locked.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sparky Defense: Intuition + Firewall Sparky is aggressive IC that wants to bring the damage right to the user, bypassing hardware en- tirely. If Sparky IC hits in cybercombat, it does (host rating + net hits) in biofeedback damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tar Baby Defense: Logic + Firewall Tar Baby is about slowing you down so you can be caught by other IC or you abandon the host in frustration. If Tar Baby hits in cybercombat, it forces link-lock.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Track Defense: Willpower + Sleaze Track IC doesn’t do harm directly&mdash;it’s about gathering information in case harm needs to be done later. If it hits in cybercombat, Track IC dis- covers the target’s physical location.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Technomancers Since the 2050s, the world has known that there are people who interact with the Matrix in unique ways&mdash;namely, they don’t need gear. The information of the Matrix flows right into their brains, and they are able to translate it into some- thing meaningful. What’s more, they can send in- formation back into the Matrix, transforming and editing it the way the rest of us do with a com- mlink. When they were first discovered, they were called otaku, the children of the Matrix, and they often aged out of their abilities by the time they turned twenty-one.</p>

<p class="calibre1">188</p>
<p class="calibre1">HOST SECURITY AND IC example Mungo finally gets his backdoor into the Stuffer Shack HQ host, but not without making the spider that is in the system suspicious of things going on, so he loads up Patrol IC, which in this system looks like a down-at- heel janitor, slowly mopping the chrome floors of the host. Mungo tries to Matrix Search for the paydata Mr.&nbsp;Johnson wants in the host, going through every corner, searching for the needle in the needlestack. While do- ing so, the Patrol IC rolls the host Device Rating of 4 x 2 and gets a surprising 8 hits. This more than beats Mungo’s Sleaze rating of 4 and adds 8 to his Overwatch Score. The spider, alerted by the janitor Patrol IC lazily pointing out Mungo’s avatar, loads up his Killer IC to do Mungo some Matrix Damage, appearing as a heavily armed Stuffer Shack worker wielding Aztechnology’s latest machine gun. Mungo, seeing that it really isn’t his day, jacks out quickly. But gracefully.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, after Crash 2.0 in 2064, the otaku van- ished. Technomancers emerged in their place, taking full advantage of the new wireless Matrix, interact- ing with it wherever they were, with nothing more than a thought. No one fully understands how they do this&mdash;magic researchers confirm that they are not Awakened, so they are not using magic. Beyond that, solid information is difficult to come by, but that doesn’t keep the corps from digging. Techno- mancers have been subjected to all manner of cruel experiments by megacorps such as Mitsuhama, and the latest whispers to emerge from the shadows hint at even darker research. When the Matrix trans- formed from an open network of wireless freedom to a tightly controlled online dystopia, the core of that network was built with the blood of techno- mancers. According to the rumors, one hundred technomancers were drawn together, supposedly to be a research team, but then their minds were har- vested, and they were killed. The foundation of the current Matrix is built from their essence. This is why technomancers often have trust is- sues. They are scorned and viewed as freaks except for when people want to exploit them, and then they are used up and thrown away like a tissue. They think society is out to get them because, time and again, it has shown that it really and truly is. They are gifted, isolated, and suspicious of ev- erything about society. They are natural shadow- runners.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Technomancers on the Street In day-to-day life, technomancers like to stay hidden. They often carry cheap commlinks, or even commlinks that are just shells with no electronics in them, just so they have some explanation for how they are able to access the Matrix. They are</p>
<p class="calibre1">often masters of the survival hack&mdash;the quick ac- tion that makes a vending machine give them free food and makes the coffin hotel forget to charge them. These little things don’t draw attention, while, say, diverting a hundred grand from your nearby bank might get people looking for you real quick. They know how to grease the wheels of life so they can get by, and they can worry intensely about making waves. So when you go to recruit them to your team, don’t make sudden motions. Is that a generalization? Sure. Are there techno- mancers who think they are the hottest drek on the planet and regularly tell everyone that fact? Abso- lutely. Every trend has outliers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Technomancers in the Shadows People who have spent a large part of their lives trying not to be noticed often make excellent shad- owrunners. The covert part of the job is second nature to them. In the Matrix, they know how to make their illegal activities seem legit. The Matrix is always around them, and many of them have no memory of life without it. The weirdness or alien nature of the Matrix that can seem off-putting to others is welcoming to them. A technomancer along for the ride means the Matrix part of your work should go smoothly and unnoticed. But what about outside the Matrix? It’s a mixed bag there, but in a good way. While they may prefer the Matrix, technomancers have to survive the meat world like everyone else, and they have learned a range of tricks to make that happen. Some of them have picked up shooting. Are they a street samurai? Naw, but they can drop an opponent distracted by the hijacked drones and malfunctioning weapons they introduce to the scene. Some might have picked up some physical skills so that they can complement their Matrix sneaking with a little sneak-behind-a- guy-and-throw-them-to-the-ground action. Others go the charm route, supplementing their ability to manipulate the Matrix with the skill to talk their way into and out of a range of situations. They are the ultimate chameleons, except more charming. The one thing you won’t see? Any sort of magic skills. Magic and Resonance simply don’t mix.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Technomancer Functions Technomancers do not use electronic devices or programs. They are the device, so they themselves are the prime source of their Matrix statistics through their living persona (p.&nbsp;189). While they can’t use programs, they can develop and implement cogni- tive patterns called complex forms (p.&nbsp;189), which might cause fading (p.&nbsp;189). They also have the abil- ity to summon beings from the Resonance known as sprites (p.&nbsp;191) who can assist them in important tasks, or even carry out those tasks by themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">MATRIX // TECHNOMANCERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">As technomancers gain experience, they can deepen their connection to the Resonance through a process called submersion (p.&nbsp;195), which can give them new abilities called echoes (p.&nbsp;195). Technomancers can experience AR, VR, and hot-sim with no extra gear, and they are difficult to spot in the Matrix, typically requiring a successful Matrix Perception test (p.&nbsp;178) with a minimum of 5 hits to be seen.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Living Persona A technomancer’s living persona has Matrix at- tributes based on their Mental attributes (as below) plus a number of bonus points equal to their Reso- nance. A single attribute cannot be raised by more than 50 percent of its base rating (rounded up, to a maximum of +4). Example: A technomancer with a Logic of 5 and a Resonance of 4 could increase their Data Processing to 8 by spending three points (half of their Logic 5, rounded up). Bonus points can be moved between two attributes with a Re- configure Matrix Attribute action. The living persona has an Initiative rank of Logic + Intuition and Initiative Dice of 1D6 plus whatever adjustments from their current Matrix mode. Use their Stun Condition Monitor in place of a Matrix Condition Monitor. Their Matrix Condition Monitor is (Logic / 2, rounded up) + 8.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Attack Charisma Sleaze Intuition Data Processing Logic Firewall Willpower</p>
<p class="calibre1">Complex Forms At character creation, technomancers get a number of complex forms equal to their initial Resonance x 2. Additional complex forms can also be bought with Karma through character advance- ment (p.&nbsp;68). The Attack Rating when using complex forms is the technomancer’s Electronics + Resonance. The mental wear-and-tear of fading is resisted with Will- power + Logic. If the damage value of fading after the resistance roll is higher than the technomancer’s Resonance, the damage is Physical; otherwise, it is Stun. The duration of complex forms is either in- stantaneous (meaning the effect happens immedi- ately, with no ongoing effect), sustained (meaning the technomancer must devote mental effort to keeping the complex form and its effect active), or permanent (meaning the effect happens and remains a permanent part of the Matrix landscape). Every complex form a technomancer sustains imposes a &ndash;2 dice pool penalty on any action.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Sprites Along with their considerable hacking pow- ers, technomancers can enlist the help of Matrix beings called sprites. Just like spirits, there is sig- nificant debate about the nature of sprites. Are they living beings waiting for a technomancer to serve? Or are they born when a technomancer compiles them? You can argue your favorite the- ory late at night over a nice round of synthahol, but out in the streets, the only thing that matters is that they work. Technomancers know how to compile them and make them follow instruc- tions. They can get the results they need, and as long as that’s the case, their exact nature is irrel- evant. A sprite’s Matrix Condition Monitor is (L /2) + 8.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Compiling a Sprite Compiling a sprite&mdash;pulling its reality out of the Resonance of the Matrix&mdash;requires the techno- mancer to first determine the level and type of the sprite they want to bring forth. Then they make a Tasking + Resonance vs.&nbsp;Level x 2 Opposed test. Any net hits they get count as tasks from the sprite. They then resist fading equal to the number of hits the sprite received on its defense test, resisted with Willpower + Charisma. The fading damage is Physical if the damage after the resistance test is higher than the technomancer’s Resonance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A technomancer may only have one unregis- tered sprite performing tasks for them (see Regis- tering a Sprite, below). The tasks a sprite performs must be clearly defined and delineated. Since sprites have limited to no sentience, the tasks can- not involve heavy decision-making. They can be one of the following things: • A single use of a sprite power; • A combat round of Matrix Actions that are all part of the same job; or • Engagement in cybercombat until all op- ponents are defeated or have left the field, or the sprite is decompiled, or the techno- mancer releases it from combat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Generally speaking, tasks have to happen in the same grid and host the technomancer is in. Sending the sprite to another host counts as a remote task. Once a remote task is completed, the sprite returns to the Resonance, no matter how many remaining tasks it had. Matrix systems do not recognize sprites as le- gitimate code, so they will therefore try to erase them. This limits their lifespans (insofar as they have life), so that they can only exist for (rating x 2) hours (unless they are registered; see Registering a Sprite, below). Sprites also accumulate OS.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Registering a Sprite If you want to preserve a sprite for a while against the Matrix’s efforts to squash it, and you want to have more than one sprite at a time, then you need to register a sprite. This is a dedicat- ed, time-consuming process; it takes a number of hours equal to the sprite’s level, and neither the technomancer doing the registering nor the sprite can take any other actions. The good news is that the sprite’s Overwatch Score does not in- crease during this process (neither does the tech- nomancer’s OS). At the end of this time, make an Opposed test of the Tasking + Resonance vs.&nbsp;the sprite’s level x 2. This causes fading of 2 DV per hit (not net hit) the sprite gets, minimum 2 DV. If you get at least one net hit on this test, the sprite is successfully registered, and the sprite is seen as a legitimate part of the Matrix. Addition- ally, net hits on the test add to the sprite’s remain- ing tasks, and the sprite faces no time limits for its existence. Its Overwatch Score is set back to zero, but it can accumulate if the sprite starts un- dertaking illegal actions. You can also now have more than one sprite&mdash;you can have a number of registered sprites equal to your Resonance level, as well as one unregistered sprite. On top of that, registered sprites can perform some special tasks, as listed below.</p>
<p class="calibre1">191</p>
<p class="calibre1">TECHNOMANCERS // MATRIX</p>
<p class="calibre1">192</p>
<p class="calibre1">compiling a sprite example Respec has her back against the wall as Killer IC is closing in on her after she made a few bad life choic- es in the wrong host. She needs backup, fast, and she knows you can’t do any better than a Fault sprite when you need an IC pick that could prevent the Titanic from sinking. She decides to make the Fault sprite have a rating of 3, and she rolls her Tasking + Resonance dice pool of 12, getting 4 hits. The Fault sprite rolls its Rat- ing x 2 for a total dice pool of 6, and gets 3 hits, which Respec has to absorb as Fading damage. She rolls to resist the Fading with Charisma + Willpower and gets 2 hits, taking 1 box of Stun Damage. The end result is that she has a friend in the fight for six hours, hope- fully long enough to deal with everything this host can throw at her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Registered Sprite Tasks Registered sprites can perform these tasks: Compiled Sprite Tasks: Anything an unregis- tered sprite can do, a registered sprite can do, too. Loaned Task: You can tell your registered sprite to follow the orders of another persona, even if that per- sona isn’t a technomancer. You get to pick how many tasks you’re loaning out. You don’t get to pick what those tasks will be, or what they can’t be, so make sure you trust whomever you loan your sprite to. Remote Task: If you send a registered sprite on a remote task, it doesn’t return to the Resonance when it’s done. Instead, it comes back to you. Re-register Sprite: You can attempt to re-regis- ter the sprite for the cost of one task, performing another Tasking + Resonance vs.&nbsp;sprite level x 2 Opposed test. If you use the sprite’s last task to do this, don’t screw up. If you succeed, add your net hits to the number of tasks the sprite owes you (minus the one for re-registering, of course). If you fail, you lose one task. If it was the sprite’s last task, it’s gone. Standby: You can tell your registered sprite to return to the Resonance but come when you call it. This costs a task, but it keeps the sprite from giving away your presence or getting in harm’s way. This also resets the sprite’s Overwatch Score. Sustain Complex Form: A registered sprite can sustain a complex form for you, so it takes the penalty from sustaining instead of you. Every task you use for this purpose lets the sprite sustain your complex form for a number of combat rounds equal to its level. You can then take over sustaining the complex form if you want.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sprite-Technomancer Link Sprites are connected to the technomancer who compiled them as long as that technomancer is con- nected to the Matrix. That connection can be used</p>
<p class="calibre1">Registering a Sprite EXAMPLE Respec likes the cut of her Fault sprite’s source code and decides to register it so it doesn’t fade away into the Matrix ether. She sets aside three hours of free time to do it, and is unable to do anything during that time except try to get the Matrix to see the sprite as part of it. She rolls her dice pool of 12 based off of her Tasking + Reso- nance ranks, while the sprite rolls its Level x 2 for a total of 6. Respec gets 1 net hit, which is enough to get the Fault sprite to be accepted by the Matrix, but the Fault sprite gets 4 hits on its resistance roll, making Respec face 8 fading damage. Respec rolls her Willpower + Charisma dice pool of 11, getting 4 hits, and she takes 4 Stun Dam- age from Fading from the work she put in. She pulls back from the Matrix and uncorks a bottle of wine to relax for an hour or two and try to get some of that Stun Damage healed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">to send words, images, video&mdash;whatever form of communication is needed is available. If the tech- nomancer loses their connection to the Matrix, the sprite will go about the task they were given when the link was lost. If the sprite is unregistered, the time limit for their existence still applies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Decompiling Sprites What goes up, must come down. What was compiled can be decompiled. Technomancers can attempt to decompile others’ sprites (or their own, if that’s what they’re into for some reason) by making a Tasking + Resonance vs.&nbsp;sprite level (+ Resonance of the technomancer who compiled the sprite, if it is registered) Opposed test. Each net hit takes a task away from the sprite. When its tasks are reduced to zero, it is decompiled, returning to the Resonance that birthed it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">decompiling a Sprite EXAMPLE Netcat finds a Crack sprite in her home host snooping around, trying to get in. She decides she wants none of what it is selling and promptly tries to throw it out of the Matrix and back into the Resonance or Dissonance from whence it came. She makes a Tasking + Resonance roll with her dice pool 12, while the Crack sprite makes a roll of its level of 4. Netcat gets 5 hits while the Sprite only gets 1 hit. This removes 4 tasks from the Crack Sprite’s number of tasks remaining, leaving it with &ndash;2 tasks, so it drifts away like bits on the electron winds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sprite Characteristics Sprites have a Device Rating and Resonance equal to their rating. Their Matrix attributes, initiative, Matrix Condition Monitor, and skills</p>
<p class="calibre1">MATRIX // TECHNOMANCERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">are based on their type and rating (see Types of Sprites, p.&nbsp;193). Sprites carry the Resonance sig- nature of their summoner. They rack up an OSjust like any other Matrix entity, and if they are con- verged upon, they vanish along with any remain- ing tasks. The physical location of the techno- mancer who compiled the thing is also revealed. The sprite has no physical location, but since it has its creator’s Matrix signature on it, it is con- nected to them. This means that someone succeed- ing in a Trace Icon action directed at the sprite will instead find the technomancer who compiled it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Types of Sprites Sprite skill ratings equal their Level. Tech- nomancers may summon the following types of sprites:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Courier Sprite Courier sprites are great at delivering messages securely and are pretty good trackers.</p>

<p class="calibre1">TECHNOMANCERS // MATRIX</p>
<p class="calibre1">194</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sprite Powers Camouflage The sprite can conceal a file within another file in such a way as to make it invisible to Matrix searches. Concealed files can only be found with a Matrix Perception test that is specifically looking for the hidden file; even the sprite must make this test in order to find and extract it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cookie A sprite uses its cookie power to “tag” a target persona with a cookie file that can be used to track the icon’s Matrix activities. The sprite must success- fully beat the target in a Cracking + Resonance vs.&nbsp;Intuition + Firewall test. If the sprite succeeds, the persona starts carrying the cookie file, none the wiser. The cookie file runs silent and is protected with a rat- ing equal to the sprite’s level. The file logs everything the icon does; for example, each host the persona en- ters, the details of any communications the persona engages in (with whom and when, but not the actual contents), any programs the icon uses, etc. Use the net hits to benchmark the depth of the data the cook- ie accumulates (1 hit providing a bare outline, 4 or more a detailed report). At the end of a time deter- mined by the sprite (or its owner) when placed, the cookie file transfers itself and its accumulated data to the sprite. Once the sprite has it, it may turn it over to the technomancer. If the sprite isn’t in the Matrix when the file transfers itself, the file is deleted. Cookie files may be detected with a successful Matrix Per- ception test performed on the carrying persona. Once identified, it may be removed by removing the file’s protection and then deleting it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Diagnostics The Diagnostics power allows the sprite to evaluate the inner workings of an electronic de- vice. The sprite can assist someone using or repair- ing the device. The sprite makes an Electronics + Level test; if any hits are rolled, the character gets a +1 die to the character’s dice pool to use (Elec- tronics, Engineering, and Piloting skills only) or repair the item. This power takes the sprite’s entire attention; the bonus lasts until the sprite drops it or does something else.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Electron Storm This attack allows the sprite to engulf a tar- get persona in a sustained barrage of corrupting datastreams. If the sprite beats the target in a Cracking + Resonance vs.&nbsp;Intuition + Firewall test, the target is swallowed in a hail of digital pulses. With the first successful attack and on each subse- quent action the sprite performs while sustaining this power, it inflicts (Resonance) DV Matrix dam-</p>
<p class="calibre1">age, resisted as normal. The engulfing storm also causes 2 levels of noise for the target. If the sprite takes any Matrix damage, all of its electron storms end immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hash The Hash power allows the sprite to temporarily protect a file with a unique Resonance algorithm in such a way that only the sprite can unprotect it. If the sprite stops carrying the hashed file, it reverts to normal. If the sprite is destroyed while carrying the file, the hashed file is permanently corrupted and becomes worthless. The maximum time the sprite can use this power is (Level x 10) combat rounds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Override This power allows the sprite to override con- trol of a device operating on autopilot. The sprite targets a device, making an Electronics + Level vs.&nbsp;Device Rating + Firewall test. If the sprite suc- ceeds, the sprite gains total control of the device and can substitute its Level for the Pilot rating of the device.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Phantom The sprite can conceal a persona or device in such a way as to make it invisible to Matrix searches. Concealed personas or devices can only be found with a Matrix Perception test that is spe- cifically looking for the hidden icon; even then sprite can make an Electronics + Resonance test, with net hits becoming the threshold for the Ma- trix Perception test.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stability A sprite can use this power on any persona or device for which it has either User or Admin ac- cess. Stability prevents normal malfunctions or ac- cidents from affecting the target (including both standard glitches and those induced by the Grem- lins or Accident powers). Ignore standard glitches and reduce critical glitches to regular glitches.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suppression Sprites are confusing at the best of times, but a sprite using Suppression is just bizarre, especially to hosts. If a sprite is in a host and using this power when the host launches IC, that IC is delayed from launching by (Level / 2) combat rounds. Delayed IC can’t act or be targeted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trap This attack allows a sprite to lock down a tar- get, preventing it from taking an action. The sprite makes a Cracking + Level vs.&nbsp;Willpower + Firewall</p>
<p class="calibre1">MATRIX // TECHNOMANCERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">test, where success means the target cannot take an action as long as the power is sustained. This power takes the sprite’s entire attention; once the sprite goes to do something else, the target can act.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Watermark The sprite can tag an icon with an invisible marking that only Resonance-driven entities can see, kind of like a Matrix signature. This allows the sprite to secretly leave messages on Matrix ob- jects. A sprite can overwrite an existing watermark with a new one. A watermark can be erased with the Erase Matrix Signature action by a Resonant being; otherwise it lasts as long as the icon does.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Submersion Technomancers gain their ability to connect to the Matrix through a mysterious power known as the Resonance. The nature of the Resonance is not fully understood, even by those who channel it. But technomancers know they do not have to understand it to use it and make themselves stron- ger. Technomancers can build a more powerful Resonance connection by submerging themselves into its pure essence. Submersion is more of a spir- itual experience than a technological one. When you submerge yourself, your ego is challenged, your awareness is stretched, and you rarely come out the other side quite the same person you were when you started. But it gives you a closer bond with the Resonance, and increased power comes with it. Submersion is measured in grades, begin- ning with Grade 1 and increasing. Each grade has a Karma cost equal to 10 + Submersion grade. Your Submersion grade can’t exceed your Resonance at- tribute. If your Resonance is ever reduced below your Submersion grade, your grade is reduced (no refunds, but you can buy it back if you can bring your Resonance back up). Submersion also gives you the chance to learn a new echo (see below).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Increased Maximum Resonance The natural maximum for your Resonance at- tribute is 6 + your Submersion grade. An increase in the maximum does not mean an automatic in- crease in your Resonance attribute&mdash;you still have to spend Karma to increase your Resonance attri- bute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Echoes Technomancers learn new powers, called Echoes, when they submerge. Each grade of Sub- mersion you gain gets you one additional Echo. Unless otherwise noted, you can’t pick the same Echo more than once. When Echoes can be taken multiple times, their bonuses stack.</p>
<p class="calibre1">• Living Network: Your living persona can function as the master device in a PAN. This Echo is only selected once. • Machine Mind: You gain the benefits of a Rating 1 Control Rig (p.&nbsp;283). This Echo is only selected once. • Matrix Attribute Upgrade: Upgrade one of your living persona’s Matrix Attributes by 1. This Echo may be taken multiple times, but each Matrix Attribute may only be upgraded twice. • NeuroFilter: You get a +1 dice pool bonus to resist biofeedback damage. This Echo may be taken twice. • Overclocking: You accelerate your living per- sona to act more quickly in the Matrix. You get an additional Minor Action and +1D6 Ini- tiative Dice while you’re in hot-sim VR. • Resonance Link: This echo gives you the ability to establish a low-level, one-way em- pathic link with another technomancer of your choice. As long as you’re linked, you can discern the dominant mood and emotions of your linked companion. You know whenev- er your companion is under attack or stress, feeling pain, or otherwise in danger. The Res- onance Link works in only one direction (so your companion does not receive empathic signals from you), but if both of you take the echo with each other, you can make a two- way link. • Skinlink: You can connect to a device as if us- ing a DNI simply by touching it. This Echo is only selected once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">submersion EXAMPLE Interlnk has finally earned the 11 Karma to get his first level of Submersion and learn the deep and dark secrets of the Matrix. He goes through a spiritual quest into the most secret parts of the Matrix, where no mere decker could ever go. He comes out a changed person and chooses to have the NeuroFilter Echo, making him less likely to experience biofeedback damage. He can’t wait to get 12 Karma to go through the rituals once more!</p>

<p class="calibre1">TECHNOMANCERS // MATRIX</p>
<p class="calibre1">While deckers and technomancers are about slinging code to gather information and control de- vices, riggers take a much more hands-on approach. Where a decker can control something remotely through a host, a rigger takes it a step further, us- ing their augmentations and specialized equipment to merge their consciousness with a device, be it a drone, vehicle, or in some cases an entire building. A rigger doesn’t just drive a car, they become it, feeling every crack under the tires or microburst along the wings of an aircraft.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Basics If you want to run vehicles, there are a few key things to know, namely: 1. You can control vehicles remotely, or you can “jump into” them for a full immersive experience. You can also drive them like an ordinary citizen. 2. Vehicles and drones can only have one driv-</p>
<p class="calibre1">er/controller at a time, regardless of method. You can’t be both jumped into a drone and controlling it remotely. 3. If the only way you have to controlling vehicles is your Piloting skill, you’re not a rigger, you’re a driver. Being a rigger means having a vehicle control rig (or being a tech- nomancer with the right complex forms). 4. Rigging can be done in AR and VR. Cold- sim VR makes your Initiative Dice 2D6, while hot-sim makes it 3D6. 5. If you’re rigging remotely, noise penalties ap- ply; see p.&nbsp;176. 6. Vehicles and drones have an Attack Rating of the driver’s Piloting skill + Sensor and a De- fense Rating of the driver’s Piloting + Armor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With that covered, let’s talk about two special- ized pieces of gear: vehicle control rigs and rigger command consoles.</p>
<p class="calibre1">RIGGING //</p>
<p class="calibre1">Control Rigs and You In order to jump into a vehicle, drone, or other supported device, a rigger must have an implanted vehicle control rig (VCR), or the appropriate tech- nomancer complex form. Each rating point of the control rig awards one extra die on tests involving the operation of a jumped-in device. While jumped in, riggers use their mind, not their meat body. As such, their Physical attributes are not used when making tests on a jumped in device. The conversion is shown in the Control Rigs chart. So, when jumped into a drone, a rigger would use Piloting + Intuition as opposed to Piloting + Reaction. Should the rigger be present in a vehicle that crashes, they would still use their Body attribute to resist the crash damage, as they are physically present in the vehicle. More information about crashes can be found in the section on Crashing (p.&nbsp;200).</p>
<p class="calibre1">CONTROL RIGS Body Willpower Strength Charisma Agility Logic Reaction Intuition</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rigger Command Console The second piece of critical equipment is the rig- ger command console (RCC), which is sometimes referred to as a captain’s chair. It gives the rigger the ability to control more than one drone or ve- hicle at a time, which is important for riggers who want to wield a drone army. An RCC can have a number of slaved drones equal to its Rating x 3. A rigger can issue a single command to any number of the drones slaved to the RCC as a Major Action. The command issued will then be carried out by the drones when their turn comes up in initiative.</p>
<p class="calibre1">rigger command console table</p>
<p class="calibre1">Along with allowing the rigger to control multi- ple drones, the RCC also provides protection to the drones. Any hacking attempts on a drone slaved to an RCC must first gain access to the RCC. In order to resist this, the RCC has its own Data Processing and Firewall ratings. The Data Processing attribute is also used to determine Initiative when running in VR with the RCC. Along with its defensive capabilities, an RCC can run autosofts and can share them out to all slaved drones. The number of programs and autosofts it can share out is equal to the RCC’s Data Processing rating. RCCs also provide noise reduction, reducing noise penalties by their Device Rating. Honest- ly, they’re super useful, and you really should have one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rigging through the Matrix Whether you are rigging with AR or VR, you’re using the Matrix, so all the aspects that come with the Matrix come with your experience. The ve- hicle or drone you’re controlling can be hacked, and your persona or those of your devices can be damaged. You also can be forcibly expelled from a vehicle or drone that you’re jumped into. As with normal Matrix use, you interact with your rigs through AR or VR, and you switch be- tween the two with the Switch Interface Mode ac- tion (p.&nbsp;184). VR can be done in cold sim (+2D6 Initiative Dice) and hot sim (+3D6 Initiative Dice).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Resisting Hacking Hackers operate on the belief that if it is on- line, it can, and probably should, be hacked. That means rigged vehicles and drones are legitimate targets. Riggers spend a significant amount of time and effort protecting their gear, and that includes liberal use of the Full Matrix Defense action (p.&nbsp;182). The Reboot Device action is also popular in emergencies, as it can expel an invading hack- er. Just don’t do it to a high-flying or fast-moving drone, because you may not like the result when the device comes back online. If it ever does.</p>

<p class="calibre1">198</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rigging and Dumpshock Unfortunately, hackers also know the uses of the Reboot Device action, and they have been known to gain control of a device just long enough to forcibly reboot it, thus expelling a jumped-in rigger. And that’s not the only way to force a rigger out&mdash;bricking the device they’re using for remote commands, whether it’s a com- mlink or RCC, or destroying the vehicle a rig- ger is jumped into expels the rigger. And if you go old-school and directly plug into a vehicle or drone to run it, and someone yanks the plug&mdash; boom, you get dumpshock, as described on p. 176. You also lose control of the vehicle, and it continues on whatever course its was on until someone takes control or something stops it. If it has an autopilot, that will guide the device, except when it reboots.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rigger Programs Riggers can utilize a number of programs that deckers usually use. Programs purchased for use on an RCC cannot be used in a cyberdeck and vice versa. As with decks, RCCs cannot run more than one program of the same type, even if you rename it. Here’s a list of handy programs for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">savvy rigger and their basic function. See the Pro- grams section of the Matrix chapter (p.&nbsp;184) for more detail. Armor: +2 to the Defense Rating against Ma- trix- and Electronic Warfare-based attacks. It also grants +2 dice to the rigger’s Damage Resistance tests when in hot sim. Encryption: +1 to Firewall. Signal Scrubber: Reduce noise by 2. Stealth: When performing Hide action, gain 1 Edge that must be spent as part of the action or vanish. Toolbox: +1 to Data Processing. Virtual Machine: 2 extra program slots; take 1 ex- tra box of unresisted Matrix damage when attacked.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vehicle Rigging So you have a control rig, and perhaps you splurged on an RCC. Let’s talk about the act of getting a vehicle to do what you want it to. First, let’s look at the numbers that determine how a ve- hicle moves. All vehicles have a Handling statistic, an Accel- eration statistic, and two statistics for speed. We’ll review what they do. The Handling statistic acts as a threshold for</p>
<p class="calibre1">RIGGING // VEHICLE RIGGING</p>
<p class="calibre1">tests made while driving the vehicle. Ground vehi- cles have two numbers that are part of their Han- dling; the first is for when they are on road, the second for off, which includes anything that’s not a paved road. Acceleration measures the maximum meters per combat round the vehicle can safely accelerate or decelerate. Then we have speed stats. Speed Interval is a measure of difficulty in driving the car&mdash;the faster the car, the trickier it is to keep under con- trol, though some cars handle speed better than others. Drivers should track their current speed; each time they pass another Speed Interval, they incur a cumulative &ndash;1 dice pool penalty to any tests involving Handling for the vehicle, as well as attacks from the vehicle. Top Speed shows</p>
<p class="calibre1">the maximum number of meters the vehicle can travel in a combat round. Beyond the speed statistics, vehicles have a Body stat to describe the general heft and solidity of their frame, an Armor stat to represent how much extra protection that frame is given, and a Pilot and Sensor stat to represent the built-in programming the vehicle has to move itself and respond to surrounding conditions. Vehicles also have a Seats listing showing how many people they carry in normal circumstances, and they have the customary Availability and Cost. Unless its description states otherwise, all vehicles and drones can operate for six hours before having to refuel or recharge. Stats for a vehicle look like this:</p>

<p class="calibre1">Distance traveled in a combat round = Speed at beginning of turn - 1/2 acceleration rate (if any).</p>
<p class="calibre1">So if you were traveling at 30 meters per combat round at the start of the turn and accelerated by 10 meters per combat round, you would have trav- eled 30 + ½(10) meters, or 35 meters. If you were traveling 30 and decelerated 10 meters per combat round, you would have traveled 30 &ndash; ½(10) meters, or 25 meters. And if you’re neither decelerating or accelerating, you travel a number of meters equal to your current speed. The second thing to know is how the speed per combat round translates into the speed referenc- es we generally use. For that, see the Meters per Combat Round table, which translates meters per combat round into kilometers per hour and miles per hour so you can know if your getaway speed is plodding or really fraggin’ fast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">vehicle movement example Turbo Bunny is starting a drive in her Americar (even the Bunny needs practical transportation some days), and she accelerates in a gentle manner&mdash;she goes from 0 meters per combat round to 8, because she’s driving easy and not flooring it. Her initial speed was zero, her acceler- ation was 8, so she moves current speed + ½(8) meters, or 4 meters. She keeps that acceleration rate up for another combat round. Her starting speed was 8, she accelerat- ed 8, so she moved 8 + ½(8) meters, or 12 meters. Her current speed is 16 meters per combat round&mdash;about 20 kilometers per hour, or 11 miles per hour. Unfortunately for her, Turbo Bunny is a little behind on payments to her BTL dealer, and he’s sent some goons to shake some nuyen out of her. She spots them in the rearview and slams the accelerator. Her current speed of 16 is under the Speed Interval of 20, so no penalties on Piloting tests for the vehicle, but there will be soon. She hits the maximum acceleration rate of 12, so the car jumps from 16 to 28. It travels 16 + ½(12) meters, or 22 meters. She’s still not moving fast, but she also is not in a machine built for chases, so it’s going to resist her ag- gressive style of driving. When a pedestrian unexpect- edly enters the street ahead of her, she has to make a Handling test to avoid them. She’s on road, so the test will be Piloting + Reaction (3). Her speed is 28, one step over the first Speed Interval, so she takes a &ndash;1 dice pool penalty to the test. She keeps up the maximum accelera- tion of 12, getting her up to 40 meters per combat round (about 48 kph, or 29.8 mph). That hits the second Speed Interval, so if she has to make Piloting tests next turn, she’ll lose two dice, all while cursing her poor overbur- dened Americar.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Tests and Driving Normal vehicle operation does not require a test. Tests only come up when a driver/rigger wants to do something tricky with the car&mdash;follow another car without being spotted, make a hairpin turn at high speeds, jump over the still-under-construction bridge, that sort of thing. The primary test is the Handling test, made to see if you can coax the vehicle to do what you want to do. The player’s dice pool is Piloting + Reaction. The basic threshold is the Handling rating of the vehicle. Vehicles have two Handling ratings&mdash;one for on-road, one for off-road, so the appropriate one for the vehicle’s current location would be used. Gamemasters can increase or decrease that threshold based on the difficulty of the attempted maneuver. Sometimes the test may be Opposed, as two driv- ers pit their skills against each other. This would be Piloting + Reaction vs.&nbsp;Piloting + Reaction&mdash;may the best driver win! Make sure each driver makes dice-pool adjustments based on their current speed (Speed Interval, p.&nbsp;199), and the gamemaster can re- quire an additional Piloting + Reaction Simple test after an Opposed test to make sure each driver is able to survive the aftermath.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crashing Should a a driver fail a Handling test, they must immediately make a crash test, which is another Pi- loting test, with Handling as the threshold. Any pen- alties based on the vehicle’s Speed Interval should be applied to this test, and the gamemaster can apply additional dice pool penalties based on the difficul- ty of the task and the level of damage the vehicle may have suffered. Should this test fail, the vehicle</p>
<p class="calibre1">crashes, and those within must resist damage equal to the speed of the vehicle in meters per round di- vided by 10. A vehicle may have safety features such as airbags, rapid-expanding foam, or even simply seat belts, which can reduce this damage before the player attempts a standard Damage Resistance test. Vehicles may be equipped with a number of weapon mounts equal to their unaugmented Body / 3 (round down). Standard weapon mounts may hold any assault rifle or smaller weapon and 250 rounds of ammo. Heavy weapon mounts count as two weap- on mounts and can hold any weapon along with 500 rounds of belted ammo or up to (Body) rockets/mis- siles. All weapon mounts are operated remotely and can target a ninety-degree arc of fire (horizontal and vertical). Manual operation can be added, but only for vehicles, not drones, and at extra cost.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Vehicle Combat We’ll divide this up into two categories: Using a weapon while in a vehicle, and using the vehicle as a weapon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Using a Weapon in a Vehicle When using a weapon mounted on a vehicle, use Engineering + Logic. Vehicle combat is a different beast than combat with your feet on the ground&mdash; there are extra calculations about movement, fir- ing arcs, and so forth that mean your ability to calculate where a projectile will go and estimate the right time to fire it is important. Speed Interval penalties (p.&nbsp;199) apply to tests to fire a weapon from a vehicle. Other than that, the procedure is the same as a regular ranged attack. Attacking with a weapon that is not mounted to a vehicle (e.g., firing a pistol or swinging your sword out a window) is the same as doing so out- side of a vehicle, but once again the Speed Inter- val penalties (p.&nbsp;199) apply. Modify the Damage Value of melee weapons by the current Speed In- terval when swinging at a stationary target, or by the difference in Speed Intervals for melee combat between two moving vehicles.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Using Vehicles/ drones as Weapon Sometimes you want to crash into another person or vehicle with the craft you’re steering,</p>
<p class="calibre1">RIGGING // VEHICLE RIGGING</p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe because you’re desperate, or you’re a psy- chopath, or something. The attempt to hit anoth- er being or vehicle is an Opposed test&mdash;Piloting + Reaction vs.&nbsp;Piloting + Reaction if you’re trying to hit another vehicle, or Piloting + Reaction vs.&nbsp;Intuition + Reaction if you’re trying to hit some- one outside a vehicle. Speed Interval penalties (p. 199) apply in either case. The Attack Rating of a vehicle is Piloting of the driver + Sensor. Individuals use their normal Defense Rating; the Defense Rating for vehicles is Piloting of the driver + Armor. Damage is (Body / 2, rounded up, +1 for each current Speed Inter- val), and it is Physical damage. Soft targets inflict (target’s Body / 4, rounded up) damage back on the vehicle. Individuals and vehicles alike resist the damage with their Body. Vehicles and drones have a single Condition Monitor that is (Body / 2) + 8. Their Handling increases by 1 for every three boxes of damage, and they break down when the entire Condition Monitor is filled up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Drone Rigging Rigging with a drone is identical to vehicle rigging when jumped in. Be aware that noise penalties may occur if the drone is too far away from the rigger. Most of the time, drone rigging is done by re- mote commands, which rely on the Pilot rating of the drone to carry out. Commanding a drone is a Major Action. Once the command is given, the drone will use its Pilot rating as its combat attri- bute, and any autosofts it is running as skills. Drones use the same statistical block as vehicles. For hacking purposes, consider their Device Rating to be equal to their Sensor rating.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Drone Initiative Drones acting on their own have an Initiative rank of Pilot x 2, and they get 3D6 additional Ini- tiative Dice (for a total of 4D6 dice). When a rig- ger is jumped in, the drone uses that rigger’s VR Initiative.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Drone Weapon Mounts and Combat Drones may be equipped with a number of weapon mounts equal to their unaugmented Body / 3 (round down). Standard weapon mounts may hold any assault rifle or smaller weapon and 250 rounds of ammo. Heavy weapon mounts count as two weapon mounts and can hold any weap- on along with 500 rounds of belted ammo or up to (Body) rockets/missiles. All weapon mounts are operated remotely and can target a ninety-degree arc of fire (horizontal and vertical). If a drone weapon is fired by the drone’s autopilot, it uses the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Attack Rating of the mounted weapon, and it uses its [Weapon] Targeting autosoft + Sensor rating. If the drone does not have the [Weapon] Targeting autosoft, then use Sensor rating &ndash; 1. Then rethink the life choices that led to you loading a weapon on a drone without the appropriate autosoft. If the rigger is jumped in, they do the firing instead of the drone, so they use their Engineering skill (which is used to fire from vehicles) combined with Logic (the jumped-in replacement for Agility).</p>
<p class="calibre1">drone combat example Emu has a roto-drone with an HK-227 mounted on it, providing backup for her escape. As she dashes out of a corporate research facility, contraband in hand, she takes a Command Drone action to order the drone to fire on a pursuing guard. The drone is at medium range to the guard, giving it an Attack Rating of 8. The guard has a Defense Rating of 6, so no Edge is given out at the start of the attack. The drone is being controlled remotely, so it fires with its HK-227 Targeting autosoft 3 + Sensor rat- ing 3, meaning that it rolls 6 dice. The defender rolls 7, so the odds are against it. The drone rolls 2 hits while the defender rolls 3. The drone misses, but the bullets whiz by close enough to make the guard think about whether he really wants to continue this pursuit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Autosofts Autosofts are programs accessed by the Pilot program in drones. They serve as skills to augment the drone’s performance. The attribute used with each autosoft is included in the listing, though re- member that riggers use their own attributes when jumped in. A drone has a number of slots for auto- softs and other Matrix programs equal to half its Pilot rating, rounded up. If a drone is slaved to a rigger command console, it uses the programs run- ning on the RCC. This can exceed its normal limit. Clearsight: This acts as the drone’s Perception skill. Attribute: Sensor Electronic Warfare: This is used as the Crack- ing skill for purposes of jamming and overcoming ECM. Attribute: Sensor Evasion: This is used when a drone attempts to evade being locked on to. A drone that is being fired at would use its Piloting + Evasion to avoid being hit. Attribute: Pilot Maneuvering: This is the Piloting skill for the specific drone (Not to be confused with Pilot Rat- ing). Attribute: Pilot Stealth: This acts as a specific type of drone’s Stealth skill. Attribute: Pilot [Weapon] Targeting: This acts as a weapon skill for the specific mounted weapon (Drones aren’t as smart as people, and need specific instructions as op- posed to broader skill groups). Attribute: Sensor</p>

<p class="calibre1">Shadowrunners need some kind of opposition or else there is no challenge to running the shad- ows. Non-player characters and critters make up the bulk of that opposition, as they represent the cast of characters the gamemaster controls. They’re strategically placed between the runners and their goals. Some are there to be defeated, oth- ers negotiated with, and sometimes they even assist the runners in their shadowy endeavors. Shadowrunners are not the only people in the world, despite their occasional views to the con- trary. The players take on the role of the player characters (PCs), while the gamemaster handles the rest of the world, all considered non-player characters (NPCs). The gamemaster also handles all the critters, mundane and Awakened alike, so they have lots of options to keep runners’ lives in- teresting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Non-Player Characters (NPCs) NPCs come in two main varieties: grunts and named characters. Details on each are in their section, but let’s first chat a little on what NPCs are and what they can do in a game. NPCs are a gamemaster’s gateway into the game. They’re the people the PCs get to interact with in order to get things done, get away with things, or get things they want. They cover everything from the dwarf squatter on the corner to the dragon CEO in the boardroom. They vary in power level, but most aren’t on par with a runner in a toe-to-toe contest. The thing to remember about NPCs is the fact that they aren’t isolated (unless they choose or are forced to be). NPCs know other NPCs and sometimes have the kinds of connections that can make a runner’s life hell. They all have their own motivations and backstories, even if the gamemas- ter sometimes makes those up on the fly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">WILD LIFE // NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS (NPCS)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Here’s how this can work: Say the characters shot a guard on the way out of the secret R&amp;D facility. That guard is now in critical care. His brother happens to be the head of corporate security and a regular con- tractor for shadow assets in town. He starts digging to find who ganked his brother, and when he finds out, he can look at multiple paths for revenge. Maybe he can go direct, hiring out an attack on the runners, or maybe he reaches out to his connections in the shad- ows and makes all the runners’ work opportunities dry up. What was an almost routine part of a run be- comes a hook for a much longer campaign. The story doesn’t always end where you think it will. A variety of NPCs are included in this chap- ter, but gamemasters are encouraged to build and customize their own in order to best fit the tone and challenge in their story. There’s no formula for building NPCs like there is for PCs. Gamemasters are free to provide whatever skills and attributes they want to fit the concept they design.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grunts Halloweeners, corporate security guards, Lone Star patrolmen, and UCAS Navy SEALs&mdash;these are just a few of the NPC templates we’ve included within the section called Grunts. Grunts aren’t nec- essarily pushovers, but they are intended to cover a broad group of individuals. Each group has a lieu- tenant level, which covers a slightly more specialized area of the Sixth World opposition. These members are still intended to be grunts, but they offer some specialized ability, be it technomancy, hacking skills, magic, or heavy augmentations. They can be used as units just like the regular grunts; they’ll just offer a very specialized challenge. Every grunt is listed with basic human baseline stats. Adjusting them for any of the metatypes is as easy as looking to the Meta- human Adjustment Chart (p.&nbsp;211) and making a few quick changes. The Combat chapter has special rules for grunts in altercations (p.&nbsp;114). Keep in mind that these rules can be used not only for laying down the hurt with fists or lead, but also when three or four se- curity guards are all at the same guard station and scrutinizing those trying to Con their way past. Ini- tiative for all grunts of the same template should be the same to make record-keeping easy, and all grunts only have a single Condition Monitor, track- ing both Physical and Stun damage all in one place. To calculate that Condition Monitor, use 8 + half of either Body or Willpower (whichever is high- er), rounded up. Lieutenants add their Professional Rating to their Condition Monitor. Grunts suffer wound modifiers for every 2 full boxes of damage. Since they only have one track, life and death is de- termined by whatever hit them last. If they were hit by Physical Damage last, they’re bleeding out or dead. If they were hit by Stun Damage last, they’re just unconscious and could be available for ques-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tioning. If all these simplifications aren’t enough, or you really want to roll out cinematic actions scenes for the runners to plow through, check out the optional rules in the Here Comes the Reaper sidebar.</p>
<p class="calibre1">here comes the reaper Optional Rules You can speed up combat with grunts in a few other ways in order to moderate record-keeping and keep you from having to make a ton of extra dice rolls behind the screen that slow down the action. All of these are best used for grunts under a Professional Rating of 3. • Grunts don’t roll for Initiative, they just use their Initiative rank as their Score. • A single would takes a grunt down. • Normal resistance rules don’t apply to grunts; all rolls made against them are unopposed. Spells go off unhindered. Grunts do not roll to dodge ranged attacks. • If a PC makes any hits on a Stealth test, grunts are automatically unaware of them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professional Rating You ever listen to a coworker complain about a splinter like it’s some kind of debilitating inju- ry, while you hear about Sioux Wildcats that keep fighting after losing a limb? That’s the difference be- tween a Professional Rating of 0 and a Professional Rating of 10. Professional Rating comes from the overall experience and discipline of an NPC. It is the simplest way to know when a grunt or group of grunts will bail from a fight. You take their Pro- fessional Rating and compare it to the number of damage boxes they’ve taken. Once the total boxes exceed the Professional Rating, make a Composure test (p.&nbsp;67) to see if they bolt. There’s some leeway in this, but as a general rule, if it looks like the fight isn’t going to go their way, grunts bail. Professional Rating is also used as the initial Edge pool of the group of grunts. They all share the pool, and no matter how you group them for attacks, they can’t use Edge more than once in a round. This means if you have a group of ten grunts split into attacking groups of four, four, and two, they can’t all use Edge in the same combat round&mdash;only one of the groups can. See the Professional Rating sidebar for a better idea of how to classify your grunts.</p>

<p class="calibre1">professional rating Rating 0 (Untrained): These guys aren’t real com- batants. They might know how to use their weapons, but they’ve never trained as a unit. Their reactions tend to be clumsy, slow, and a bit chaotic. If somebody in their group goes down, the rest tend to turn tail and run. Examples include mall cops and random street mobs. Ratings 1&ndash;4 (Semi-trained): These grunts have had some training and can work a little better as a team, but don’t have a lot of field experience. They can follow a plan, but they have a hard time keeping their cool under fire. If they lose more than a quarter of their number, the team will stop fighting and make a retreat. Examples in- clude rookie beat cops, low-end gang members, and basic corporate security teams. Ratings 5&ndash;7 (Trained): This is where the trouble starts. At this point they are well trained, have seen a fair amount of combat, and have earned the coolness of the veteran. If they take casualties over half of their number, they’ll make a tactical withdrawal. They don’t run. They run and gun. Examples include professional bodyguards, HTR and SWAT teams, mercenary units, and top-tier cor- porate security forces. Ratings 8&ndash;10 (Elite): These are the best of the best, often better than most runners. They live to bring the fight. As top-tier professionals, they will not break. They’ll fight to the last person or until they get orders to with- draw. Examples include military special forces units and fanatics and madmen who would die before failing their cause. The fanatics and madmen are interesting because they often lack the training and skill but don’t stop com- ing, even though they die in droves.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Prime Runners Grunts, no matter how tough, or what their Professional Rating is, are intended to be nameless cannon fodder. Prime runners are different. They get names and agendas. They use grunts to do their bidding and send them after the PCs. The prime runners move plots forward and make the shad- owrunning world truly interesting. They can be the corp exec who has a vendetta against the runners for thwarting her latest promotion with their re- cent run, a local mob soldier who lost his lover when the runners shot up a restaurant to “send a message,” or even just a local shop owner who doesn’t appreciate the type of business the runners are bringing around and works toward getting them caught without directly attacking them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Building Prime Runners Prime runners aren’t just a set of numbers and gear. They should be as real and well thought out as the characters. They should have a backstory, a drive, and maybe even some skeletons in their own closet. This can mean building them out fully with the rules in the Character Creation chapter (p.&nbsp;58) and then boosting them with Karma. This way you can make prime runners of comparable experience to the PCs. Prime runners can be grouped into four comparative categories: Inferior, Equal, Superior, and Superhuman. Inferior: These prime runners don’t match up favorably with the PCs, but they offer story hooks, moral challenges, and, perhaps the most worri- some, the friend-of-a-friend (FOAF) problem. The FOAF problem is a classic presentation of a weak- er foe. The actions of the PCs determine wheth- er this FOAF becomes an ally, when they help the weak friend, or an enemy, when they pick on the weak friend. Equal: Right on par with the PCs, these foes come from a pool of shadowrunners, company suits, government agents, and syndicate enforcers. They push the story by challenging the runners at every turn. They usually have a team of allies who help back their play&mdash;just like the runners. Superior: Intended to be more than a match for a single PC, but in a bit deep if the team decides to work as a team. When building a Superior foe, don’t worry about the gear limits of character cre- ation (see p.&nbsp;66)&mdash;they can own top-notch gear. Superhuman: You killed his dog, and now he’s after you. Yeah, these guys are like that. They can reasonably take on your entire team, and over- coming a foe like this is going to take more smarts than brawn. Or a Thor shot. A Thor shot would do it. Certainly not limited by the gear limitations of character creation, these foes are going to have toys the runners drool over, before they’re bleeding because of them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">WILD LIFE // NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS (NPCS)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prime runners are built with the Priority Table (p. 64) with a few alterations across the categories. Infe- rior prime runners use the Priority Table but always use the next lower level for each choice. For example, if you dedicate Priority A to Resources for an Inferior prime runner, you only get the Resources from Prior- ity B. The exception to this is Priority E, which can’t get lower, so they get two items from that row. Equal prime runners are built just like runners, including the customization Karma and given ad- ditional Karma to match the current advancement of the PCs. Superior prime runners should be ad- vanced with fifty to one hundred more Karma than the PCs’ total. Superhuman prime runners should far overshadow the PCs’ Karma total. Once they are made, prime runners shouldn’t remain stagnant. As the characters gain Karma, so should the prime runners who oppose them, offer- ing a continuing challenge to the PCs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Edge and Prime Runners Edge for prime runners is pretty simple: They get their own&mdash;and then some! Prime runners have their own Edge attribute and earn Edge indepen- dent of grunts or anyone else. As they are all NPCs under the control of the gamemaster, grunts loyal to a particular prime runner can use their Edge in favor of their mentor/boss/master/friend. That’s the nice way of saying the prime runner in charge can steal from the Edge pool created by their grunts’ Professional Rating. They’re still limited on how much and how often they can spend as per the rules on Edge (p.&nbsp;44), but they have quite a bit to use to thwart the PCs’ attempts to defeat them. A final important point on Edge and prime run- ners is the Not Dead Yet use of Edge (p.&nbsp;48). Dice rolls aren’t always reliable to keep a major player alive in a story with tough people like shadowrun- ners. A bad streak on the dice, and suddenly that campaign you had built around this NPC is about to get scrapped because the street sam rolled hot and you rolled garbage. In those cases, the gam- emaster has every right to use the Not Dead Yet function and burn one of the prime runner’s Edge to keep them alive. As a sign of the PCs’ success, prime runners drop their maximum Edge attribute by one, taking a long-lasting hit to their overall abilities as a result of the PCs’ skill.</p>
<p class="calibre1">CONTACTS In the shadows of the Sixth World, you are who you know. It’s not just the face who needs con- nections out in the world. Street sams may solve most of their problems with hot lead or cold steel, but they need to get that lead and steel somewhere and know someone to help them get out of trouble when that lead and steel find their way into the wrong person. Enter contacts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Contacts are NPCs who serve as sources of goods, information, and services. They’re the sup- port and supply chain for the shadows that give the runner teams of the world a chance against the massive resources of the megacorps. Contacts are not omniscient. They have a particular area of specialty, but they can usually reach out to oth- ers in their network, for a fee, and at the risk of warning folks someone is asking questions about something they shouldn’t be.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Contacts by the Numbers A smart shadowrunner makes sure to see and schmooze their contacts often. Contacts can come from the collection we’ve provided but can also be created like prime runners, using the priority sys- tem and setting most of them as Inferior or Equal to the PCs. Gear and other goodies can be assumed to fit the life of the character, possibly pushing their property beyond the resources they have in char- acter creation. This gives you their attributes and skills, but the two most important characteristics for a contact aren’t built in&mdash;they are Connection and Loyalty, as discussed on p.&nbsp;51.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sample Contacts Anyone can be a contact. Here we’ve gathered a collection and offer up some basic stats both for the purposes of using them as a contact or for when the drek hits the fan and you need to know just how squishy they are. As they are a valuable resource, run- ners will want to protect those they are more loyal to, which is why we put the numbers here. Most are list- ed with basic human stat lines; for metahuman ver- sions, modify them with the Metahuman Adjustment Chart (below). A few are listed as a particular meta- type because it fits the concept, and you can tweak that one with the same chart bydoing a little math. For each contact, there’s a brief description, as well as a list of uses served by the contact, typical meeting places, similar contacts, and game statis- tics. Due to the flexible nature of a contact’s equip- ment, no gear or gear stats are included in their stat block.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Bartender Uses: Information, additional contacts, back rooms for private meets Places to Meet: Any bar/nightclub Similar Contacts: Bar/nightclub owner, bouncer, waitstaff, stripper Bartenders serve drinks. But they also serve as counselor and shoulder to cry on for anyone who’s had a rough day and walks through the doors of their joint. They see and hear just about everything, so it can be valuable to get to know them and to make their tip ARO chime with a little financial gratitude. Bartenders know everyone, so they’ll be able to let you know who hasn’t been in for a while, whose kid has run away from home this time, whose hus- band is screwing some other guy&mdash;just about any- thing you might want to know. They can also con- nect you to the local rumor mill, even offering up some juicy tidbits one of their customers let slip in a haze of gin and tonic. They can guide newbies to suppliers of a variety of goods and services. It’ll all cost you, of course&mdash;sometimes straight-up nuyen, sometimes a round for the house to keep the good will flowing. Besides knowing a lot, bartenders are valued for their discretion. They won’t just spill to anyone without a really good reason. Like we said, it’ll cost you … but it’s usually worth it to keep them (and sometimes their other customers) happy.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Beat Cop Uses: Information, additional contacts, gear Places to Meet: The streets of his beat, coffee shops Similar Contacts: Detective, snitch, undercover cop, rent-a-cop They’ve walked the streets of their beat for so many years that the people they’ve met and the time that has passed all blend together, but they’ve seen everything that happens there, and the import- ant stuff always sticks out. They know who’s local, who’s an out-of-towner, where the dealers work and live, which gang rules which strip of pavement, and where the down-and-out go to get a little BTL re- lief. And they’ve got the inside line on all of it&mdash;what they don’t know now, they will soon enough. With a wide network of snitches making sure to keep their local law happy, cops have a long list of their own contacts they can tap for a good chummer or the right price. Sometimes the beat is literal as they beat feet on the pavement, but more often they’re moving with a police cruiser, a motorcycle, a four-wheeler, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">even a horse. However they get around, they make an effort to see everything they can. Some are hon- est straight-shooters. Some are crooked as frag and would sell their own mothers if the nuyen was right. Working with the beat cop is all about knowing them, knowing their desires, their dreams, and often their vices so that you can get them what they want&mdash;and they can give you what you want in return.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Fixer Uses: Jobs and cred, information, gear, addi- tional contacts Places to Meet: Local bars or clubs, coffee shops, street corners where surveillance is next to impossible Similar Contacts: Fence, loan shark The first person any runner should get to know is a good fixer. They can connect you with anything and everything you could ever need in the shadows. If they don’t have it, a good fixer will know some- one who does. For a fee, of course, but what else would you expect? Fixers operate as hubs of the shadows, able to get you jobs, track down equip- ment, and even sell the things you might have picked up along the way&mdash;gear, data, prototypes, whatev- er. They know you, and they know the people who want what you have. Their services are never cheap, though. Whether it’s a straight fee or a percentage, they always get a cut of the action. The harder their efforts or the further they need to stick out their neck, the bigger their cut. The most important thing to know about a fixer is where you stand with them. You need to get in close, and the faster you do it, the more likely they will value your continued business more than that of another cli- ent. Never think of a fixer as just some acquaintance or distant friend&mdash;you want to make it so that when the chips are down, they’ll keep your name off their lips while looking for ways to keep you safe. Or better yet, they’ll help you work out a deal where they act like they’re giving you up, and whoever is after you walks into a warehouse to get you, but that warehouse happens to be stacked with C4. fixer B A R S W L I C ESS 2 2 2 2 3 2 4 4 6</p>

<p class="calibre1">Mafia Consigliere Uses: Information, additional contacts Places to Meet: Restaurants, casinos, bars Similar Contacts: Yakuza wakagashira, Triad incense master The crime syndicates of the world have fingers in every pie, and while a runner can’t just stroll into the local Mafia don’s office, they can get in close with the power behind the throne of that criminal empire&mdash;the consigliere, or counselor. Usually not actually a member of the Family, for degrees of separation and safety from being back- stabbed in a power grab, the consigliere has access to the Family’s secrets as the don’s most trusted advisor, and they often operate on behest or for the benefit of the family through back channels, like shadowrunners. The place of confidence they hold gives them access to information and insight on the family’s business, their plans, and their mindset. Though not related by blood, they know their place and generally aren’t foolish enough to throw their life away for nothing. Trying to black- mail them will usually just get you on the Family’s hit list, as they fear the wrath of the boss finding</p>
<p class="calibre1">out they betrayed the Family more than almost anything else. Their secrets aren’t given up lightly, since the life of a rat is worthless and short. You always have to offer him something of value to the Family to get information, often in the form of a favor rather than money, since few consiglieri are poor. Help deal with a problem that the Family shouldn’t touch on its own, or offer some paydata on their enemies, and then you can be rewarded appropriately. On the other side of the coin, betray their trust, and they will also be sure to reward you appropriately. The consigliere typically holds a tra- ditional job outside the Family business. Many of them are, perhaps not surprisingly, lawyers.</p>

There’s also the case of a car full of bullet holes get- ting a bit too much unwanted attention. To keep your vehicles up to snuff, it’s good to know a me- chanic. Whether you need them to fix what’s bro- ken or improve what’s not, given sufficient time and cash, they can make the worst junkyard recovery rise from the ashes like a phoenix. Mechanics also tend to double as used-car salesmen, as they have tons of junkers lying around they’ve fixed up to sell for a little profit. They also tend to have connections around the community, so if they don’t have the ride you’re looking for, they know someone who does.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Mr.&nbsp;Johnson Uses: Shadowruns, job-related information, ad- ditional contacts Places to Meet: Just about anywhere he wants Similar Contacts: Company man, government agent If you want consistent work and the consistent flow of nuyen that comes with it, you’ll want sev- eral Mr.&nbsp;Johnsons who have you and your team at the top of their list. While they don’t officially exist, Mr.&nbsp;Johnson gets around, because without them, all shadowrunners would be out of a job. The anony- mous moniker stands between the shadows and the corps as the one who gets their hands dirty so the powers of the world don’t have to. They are the key piece that makes runners deniable assets. Mr.&nbsp;Johnson sets the meet, hires their favor- ite (or least-favorite) talent, and pays for results. They’ll be your source for initial information on the job they’re hiring you for, or at least the in- formation they are willing to offer and feel you’re going to need. Their position near the corps means they can occasionally procure some of the special- ized items you might need to complete the job. Mr.&nbsp;Johnson is a font of connections and has a long memory for both success and failure, though the latter sticks longer. While some have a reputation for double-crossing their assets, a lot of that is street legend, since double-crossing Mr.&nbsp;Johnsons need to be especially careful or they’ll find a team of runners gunning for them. If you treat them</p>
<p class="calibre1">well, they’ll generally return the favor. Screw one over, even once, and you just might find out what it’s like to be on the other side of a team of shad- owrunners&mdash;or worse, slowly starving as every job in the city dries up.

<p class="calibre1">Street Doc Uses: Medical care, information, additional contacts, gear (drugs) Places to Meet: Local clinic, body shop Similar Contacts: EMT, ambulance driver, street mage/shaman Those pesky rules about gunshot wounds and calling the local policing corp make traditional medical treatment, for a shadowrunner, a bit of an inconvenience. Add in paperwork, and there- fore paper trails (yes, we know it’s all electronic), and you’ve got an ARO pointed right toward you when the investigations begin. When it comes to shadow medical care, you need to know a street doc. Most of them operate out of local clinics or body-mod shops and sneak in bleeding runners through the back entrance. The best ones don’t ask a lot of questions, except the universal opening line: “Who’s paying for this?” Street docs are stereotyped as disgraced docs, but some are medical school dropouts, nurses, or former combat medics looking to make a little extra nuyen on the side or doing the only job they know how to do. The top-end ones, those who were former docs, will often offer services other than just putting you back together, like installing new (or lightly used) cyberware. Which means many also offer an addi- tional way of paying your street doc, as most don’t have an account with Zeiss or EvoWare to order new cyber through. Instead, they pay decently for used ’ware, or bodies with used ’ware in them. Just remember to keep your street doc happy. You might get better deals, receive better treatment, and be a lot less likely to die on the table and have your parts sold to organleggers.</p>

If you have a consumer, you need a supplier, and for specialty items like magical foci, reagents, ritual supplies, and components, you have the talismonger. Awak- ened folks are rare, talismongers are rarer, mean- ing they’ll see just about everyone in their area who’s got a lick of magical talent pass through their shop sooner or later. This access to all folks arcane makes them a great source of information on who’s doing what and who’s selling what, and they’re also a great source of the latest and great- est rumors in the local Awakened community. They make a fine link to local street mages if you need a little extra arcane assistance. Talismongers with a decent amount of talent, or at least a decent amount of alchemical and enchanting talent, are often enchanters themselves, making them a great source of custom magical gear. Those with talent give you the chance to bring in some shiny bit you snagged off a corp wagemage and find out whether it’s valuable or just a bauble.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Critters Most of the monsters you meet in the Sixth World are other humans and metahumans, but that does not mean they are the only dangers you’ll face. Every environment, from the driest desert to the coldest wasteland to the densest urban jungle, has a host of wildlife that can make shadowrun- ners’ lives more interesting. Some of these are ani- mals that have been around for eons, while others are creatures that have been twisted by the Awak- ening and have developed new and alarming traits and abilities. Select critters have both Physical and Stun Condition Monitors. Here is a rundown of some of the animals you might run into on the job.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mundane Critters The majority of the Earth’s animal kingdom weren’t affected by the Awakening&mdash;instead, they were shaped by rampant pollution, overhunting, destruction of their habitats, and metahumankind’s continued disregard for anything that doesn’t fuel the bottom line. This table shows basic stats of some normal, everyday critters that a shadowrun- ner might encounter on a dark night.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Awakened critters Barghest A metaspecies of the English mastiff, the barghest stands about eighty-five centimeters at the shoulder and weighs approximately ninety kilograms. Short, sleek fur, either pure white or pure black, lies flat on its massively muscled body, creating the illusion of a naked hide. Sharp spines protrude along the length of its back. Its eyes shine red, and its teeth glow slightly in the dark because of luminescent bacteria in their saliva. During breeding season, they hunt alone or in pairs; at other times they hunt in packs of twelve or more. A number of corps have attempt- ed to use barghests as guard animals, with mixed results, especially with the use of the howl. Natural Habitat/Range: Urban areas in North America and northern Europe, particularly the British Isles. Barghests have also turned up in Aus- tralia, Hong Kong, and Nairobi, pretty much any- where the British Empire once touched.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Basilisk A metaspecies of the komodo dragon, the bas- ilisk averages approximately 2.6 meters from its snout to the tip of its tail, and it weighs around 100 kilograms. They stand about 50 centimeters at the shoulder, are somewhat broader than their progenitor, and have a spiny dorsal fan, about thirty centimeters in height at its tallest point, running most of their length. Their scales are heavy. Usual coloration is black and bright yel- low, with a solid black snout and tail tip. Their</p>
<p class="calibre1">maws are filled with sharp, saw-edged teeth that are constantly replaced as they’re lost. Not sur- prisingly, they’re aggressively carnivorous, typi- cally feeding on fish and small mammals. They cheerfully glut themselves on anything they can catch, up to and including metahumans. Extreme- ly territorial, they are relatively easy to train and are used extensively as guard animals by a num- ber of megacorps throughout the Sixth World but usually cannot be prevented from eating things they kill. Natural Habitat/Range: Native to Indonesia, basilisks can now be found in temperate and trop- ical woodlands worldwide thanks to corporate es- capes and ridiculous attempts to make them pets. They are powerful swimmers, so their natural lairs are always near running water.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Cerberus Hound As they say, three heads are better than one. The Cerberus hound is easily identified by its trio of canine heads, or the fact that it stands 1.2 meters at the shoulder and weighs in at over 110 kilos on average. These beasts are fierce hunt- ers, capable of attacking with all three heads at once, increasing the chances of one getting a good chunk, or a strong hold. Smart prey will run away. The Cerberus hound is well known for running down prey over long distances once it is on the trail. This long-range hunt is aided by the crea- ture’s paranatural ability to move quickly and un- hindered through any terrain. Captive hounds have been trained and used for corporate installation security on a few occasions. Their relentless desire to hunt down prey once it has been chosen makes control of the animals diffi- cult, but security firms have started using Cerberus hounds to track runners who have stolen valuables from facilities by releasing the trained hounds once they are on the scent and activating a tracking col- lar. Natural Habitat/Range: Forest and mountain regions, particularly the Greek Isles. Cerberi also turn up in North America and across Europe and Asia in spots where security companies took them and couldn’t handle them.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Cockatrice A metaspecies of the chicken, the cockatrice resembles an emu with a chicken’s head and a long blue tail. Standing two meters in height and weighing approximately 45 kilograms, the cocka- trice has long blue legs, yellow plumage, a bright red comb on its head, and a sharp, horny beak. They are predatory and carnivorous, often hunting in packs. They hunt by chasing their prey, leaping into the air, and attacking with their tails to para- lyze their prey, then tearing them apart and dining at their leisure. They are not at all choosy about their diet and will take on just about anything up to the size of an ork if it looks like it might be tasty. Cockatrices are popular security critters for many corps around the world. Guard specimens are typically imprinted from hatching onto their han- dlers, of whom they become extremely protective. Natural Habitat/Range: Originally found in open grassland and scrubland in western Europe, the cockatrice can now be found worldwide in a variety of environments.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Devil Rat/Demon Rat/Glitch Rat The devil rat is completely hairless and mea- sures approximately a meter in length, including its tail. A standard specimen weighs three to four kilograms. The demon rat is a subspecies and mea- sures about one and a half times the length and double the weight of a devil rat, while the glitch rat, another subspecies, is about two-thirds the length and weight of its parent species. Devil rats</p>
<p class="calibre1">are nocturnal pack hunters, with hunting packs of thirty or more mature individuals a norm. Larg- er packs have been observed, especially under the guidance of a demon rat or two, which are capable of leading devil rats, glitch rats, and mundane rats. They are fearless and vicious, making them seem outright malicious. Typically seeking out small an- imals to feed on, they are not afraid to take on a metahuman if they sense weakness. They breed prolifically, and that fact combined with their nat- ural immunity to most poisons makes them all but impossible to exterminate. Natural Habitat: Urban areas worldwide</p>

<p class="calibre1">Ghoul A metahuman infected with Type-3 HMHVV (sometimes called the “Krieger strain,” after the virologist who first identified it), the ghoul is con- sidered one of the weakest expressions of the virus, and often the most pitiable. The transformation, which can take days, is agonizing, and many do not make the transition with their sanity intact, becom- ing “feral” and hunting in packs in the abandoned and disused corners of the barrens and urban un- derworlds. While those who retain their sanity may seek to keep their feral brethren in check, all too of- ten these vicious creatures run free in search of their needed sustenance: raw metahuman flesh. Physical transformations are drastic, with the skin becoming gray and scabrous, fingers extend- ing and nails growing into sharp, black claws. Teeth grow longer and pointed. Their eyes film over with white cataracts, driving them blind without cyber- netic replacements, forcing them to depend on as- tral sight and their enhanced sense of smell. Ghouls are the most populous of all Infected, as Krieger is the most virulent and infectious strain, communicable by fluid contact such as saliva or blood. They also have the most representation in society, from the Ghoul Liberation League to the African nation of Asamando, a land ruled by ghouls and sustained by metahuman trafficking. For a brief period, UCAS Special Order 162 grant- ed ghouls rights as metahumans, but it was re- pealed after a brief time. More violent and venge- ful ghouls may find employment and belonging in the ranks of the 162 ghoul gang, or working for Tamanous organleggers for their pound of flesh. Range: Worldwide; wherever metahuman flesh is available to consume!</p>

<p class="calibre1">Hell Hound The hell hound is a metaspecies of the German shepherd, standing about 90 centimeters at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder and weighing about 70 kilograms. Their fur is as black as a moonless night, and the sclera of their eyes is red rather than white. They are pack-hunting predators, typically hunting small game up to the size of a deer in groups of four to seven hounds, though they will scavenge if prey is scarce. If their pack is large enough, they will go af- ter larger animals, including metahumans. They’re popular as security animals, especially in isolated facilities in rural areas, where bursts of flame carry less risk of property damage. Natural Habitat/Range: Primarily woodland areas of North America, but anywhere domesticat- ed dogs are present.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Vampire A human (and rarely other metatypes) infected with Type-1 HMHVV (Harz-Greenbaum strain), the vampire is the most common expression of the strain. Retaining their sanity and intelligence, some vampires also attempt to integrate into soci- ety with minimum harm to others. Once, this was easier, as vampires were notable among their kin for being capable of restraining their thirst. Unfor- tunately, unexplained changes to all Infected across the world over the past few years have sharpened their appetites, and now more and more of them are falling to their hungers for metahuman blood and souls, reveling in the rush of inflicting pain to fuel their immortality. With their regeneration and ability to take the form of mist, they are uncanny predators. While their appearance is largely unchanged after the transition, vampires are often quite pale unless they have fed recently. During times of emo- tional stress or hunger, their eyes often glow red, and their canines extend into sharp points for bit- ing and draining their prey. Vampires must ingest metahuman blood at least every few days and must drain at least one point of Essence from their victims once every lunar month. Attempting to consume anything else results in physical illness within an hour as they expel the mundane meal. Alcohol reacts even faster, often within minutes or less. HMHVV often unlocks latent mutations such</p>

<p class="calibre1">Dracoforms Dracoforms is a fancy term for dragons. These enormous, magical reptilian creatures, straight out of the myths and legends of humankind, are intel- ligent, devious, and possibly immortal, or close to it. Their age and power allow them the opportuni- ty to make elaborate plans with multiple contin- gencies based on a very long view for just about any endeavor. Most dragons are solitary creatures who avoid unnecessary contact with the “younger races,” as they call metahumans. Many dragons, though, have been taking more public roles in the Sixth World in recent years. This may or may not work out well for metahumanity. What is known about dragons is limited but has grown substantially over the years. Most things we know came from interviews conducted with the great dragon Dunkelzahn and the autopsy of Dzitbalchén that was released on the Matrix in 2064 after the government of Aztlan executed the feathered serpent. All dragons have certain powers that are common to all varieties of their kind. Addition- ally, individual specimens have exhibited other powers that are not universal. All dragons are capable and powerful magicians, practitioners of a magical tradition that predates metahuman- ity. There are no known dragon adepts, though that should not be taken to mean that such a thing is impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Magic attribute shown for dragons does not include any increases due to Initiation; it would be foolish to believe that any dragon isn’t at least a mid-level initiate. Note that the skill levels in this list are average for a typical adult dragon. Individual specimens might ex- hibit higher or lower scores in any particular skill. This is also not an exhaustive list of any dragon’s skills. Common Skills: Astral 9, Athletics 7 (Flying +2), Close Combat 7, Conjuring 7, Perception 8, Sorcery 9 Common Powers: Dragonspeech, Dual Na- tured, Elemental Attack (usually Fire), Enhanced Senses (smell, low-light vision, thermograph- ic vision, wide-band hearing), Hardened Armor (MAG), Hardened Mystic Armor (MAG), Natural Weapon, Sapience Individual Powers: Animal Control, Compul- sion, Corrosive Saliva, Fear, Influence, Noxious Breath, Venom Notes: All dragons have a Magician ranking and know several spells.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eastern Dragons Eastern dragons are native to eastern Asia. An eastern dragon is approximately thirty meters long from nose to tail, and it stands approximate- ly 2.5 meters high at the shoulder. They are col- orful and serpentine. Their heads are broad and adorned with a chinful of whiskers that extends to the rear portions of the skull. They also have multiple pairs of horns rising from behind their eyes, and a pair of barbules descends from be- neath the pronounced nasal region. Their bodies are covered in scaly armor; a spiny fan runs the length of the back and down the tail. The highly dexterous paws are four-fingered (though some variants may possess three or five fingers per paw), with each digit ending in a large claw. The most common pattern of eastern dragon color- ation is iridescent green with golden whiskers and belly scutes, but various other color patterns have appeared. Sirrush: The sirrush is indigenous to Asia Minor and appears similar to the eastern drag- on. It has longer limbs than the eastern dragon, though, and it’s a bit shorter at twenty-five me- ters in length. The difference in average length is almost entirely due to the much shorter tail of the sirrush. It also has a longer, narrower head without the whiskers and barbules of its eastern cousin. A sirrush isn’t as colorful as the eastern dragon, either; its scales tend to be in earth tones of brown, grey, gold, and terra cotta. In terms of game statistics, however, a sirrush is identical to an eastern dragon.</p>

As the name implies, they’re long and serpentine, averaging about twen- ty meters in length, and they have only two pairs of limbs&mdash;their wings and a pair of legs, similar to a wyvern. While their bellies are scaled, most of their body is covered in feathers. These contour feathers, as well as their prominent ruffs and wings, display a rainbow of colors. Their wings have a span be- tween fifteen and eighteen meters. Their legs end in paws with five digits, one of which is an opposable thumb. They can easily manipulate objects with these if they so desire. Feathered serpents frequent- ly have a tail stinger or fangs with potent venom.</p>

They have six ap- pendages, four legs in addition to their wings; the rear paws are adapted into feet, though the fore- paws have opposable thumbs and can manipulate objects easily. Dorsal spines or fans are present in some, but not all, specimens. Western dragons are usually a single color, though they exhibit darker shades along the spine and paler shades on the belly. All western dragons have heavy scales; some also have bony plates act- ing as additional armor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">WILD LIFE // CRITTERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Powers Whenever a critter does something out of the ordinary, like flying when physics says it shouldn’t, rending armor and flesh with claws, or paralyzing a target with a touch or a gaze, it’s using a critter power. Critter powers are either natural or mag- ical in nature. Natural powers, such as claws or tough skin, are innate, part of the creature’s nat- ural makeup. Magical powers, like a barghest’s Paralyzing Howl, operate more like spells, though usually without the need to cast them. Using a power against or on behalf of a target requires both critter and target to be on the same plane, either astral or physical. Astral forms cannot affect physical targets, and physical forms cannot affect astral targets (see The Astral Plane, p.&nbsp;159). Astral critters with the Materialization power can affect physical targets if they use that power first to form on the physical plane. Dual-natured critters can in- teract with both, attacking or assisting targets on the astral plane as easily as the physical one. Each power entry lists the common characteris- tics defined below: Type: Powers may be either mana (M) or phys- ical (P). Mana powers do not affect nonliving tar- gets, whereas physical powers cannot be used in astral space or to affect astral forms. Action: Most powers require a certain type of action (Minor or Major) to activate. Some are al- ways on and require no action to activate; these are listed with an Action of “Auto.” Range: All powers have a range; this is listed as Line of Sight (LOS), Touch, or Self (the power af- fects only the critter itself). The Line of Sight rules for spellcasting (p.&nbsp;131) apply to critter powers as well. Unless noted, a power may only be used on a single target at a time. Duration: This entry indicates how long the effects of a power last. Powers with an Action of Auto are constantly in effect and have a duration of Always. Instant powers provide their effect and vanish in the same action. Sustained powers may be maintained over time at no effort or cost. Crit- ters are not subject to any modifiers for keeping an effect going, as magicians are for sustaining spells, though they are limited as to the number of pow- ers they can have going at one time. Critters may sustain a number of powers (or multiple uses of the same power) at one time equal to their Mag- ic. The exception to this is the Innate Spell power, where Sorcery is used to cast the spell. The Innate Spell must be sustained per the Sorcery rules on p.&nbsp;132), but critters can sustain multiple spells as per those rules. Permanent powers must be maintained for a specific period of time before the effects be- come permanent, as noted in the power’s descrip- tion. Some powers have a Special duration and will have details noted in the description.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Accident</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Major LOS Instant Critters with this power can cause seemingly normal accidents to occur. The exact nature of the accident is up to the gamemaster, based on what the target is doing and what’s going on around him. This power isn’t dangerous in and of itself, but circumstance and environment can come into play to make it so. For example, blowing a tire and swerving in front of an oncoming drone bus could be hazardous to your health. When a critter targets someone with this power, make an Opposed test, using the critter’s Magic + Willpower against the target’s Reaction + Cha- risma. If the critter wins, treat it as if the target rolled a glitch on a test and use the Glitch Ideas (p. 233) if you want. If the critter scores 4 or more net hits, the accident is treated as a critical glitch&mdash;it’s not just an embarrassing fumble, it’s a potential catastrophe.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Animal Control</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION M Major LOS Sustained Some critters can manipulate other critters, usu- ally mundane ones, but not always. The behavior must be “normal” for the target animal. A flock of birds couldn’t steal a motorcycle, but they could certainly empty their bowels on it, follow it, or land all over it. New control commands can only be issued while still in the controlling critter’s line of sight, but targets will continue to follow any orders they had already been given for the crit- ter’s Charisma in minutes. The critter may control a number of small animals (cats, rats, etc.) equal to its Charisma x 5, a number of larger animals (wolves, lions, bears, etc.) equal to its Charisma, or a single appropriate paranormal critter. This pow- er may not be used on any critter with the Sapience power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Armor</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Auto Self Always Scales, dermal bone deposits, a thick hide, or a heavy layer of fur and fat all offer a critter with this power some inherent protection from physi- cal attacks. The critter’s natural Armor increases the Defense Rating of the critter and is cumulative with the boost from any worn armor.</p>

<p class="calibre1">POWERS // WILD LIFE</p>
<p class="calibre1">222</p>
<p class="calibre1">Astral Form</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION M Auto Self Always A critter with this power only exists on the as- tral plane. It can only be affected by astral attacks or mana spells/powers; physical attacks or spells/ powers have no effect. An astral critter can only affect dual-natured beings or those on the astral plane, whether through astral projection or astral perception. Critters with this power may manifest on the physical plane in the same ghostly way as astrally projecting magicians (see p.&nbsp;160).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Binding</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Major Varies Instant It may be webbing, a sticky goo, a sticky tongue, or some magical force that allows a critter with this power to maker its target stick to any surface the target happens to be touching, including the critter itself. The range of this power depends on how the critter binds its targets; it may shoot something (Range: LOS), have a sticky body (Range: Touch), or just be good at sticking to things (Range: Self). For LOS range, the critter makes an attack using Magic + Agility vs.&nbsp;Athletics + Reaction. A successful hit applies the Immobilized status. The target is affected and must spend a Major Action on its turn in order to make an escape attempt. For Touch range, the critter makes an attack us- ing Magic + Agility vs.&nbsp;Close Combat + Reaction. A successful hit applies the Immobilized status with a small variation. In this case, the target is stuck to the creature and cannot move away with- out first breaking free, but the creature can move with the target as long as its Strength is at least 1/2 the target’s Body. Breaking free is described below. For the Self range, no roll is made, and the crit- ter is allowed to move along vertical and inverted surfaces at their normal Movement rate. Breaking free from this power requires a Ma- jor Action. Roll Strength + Body against the crit- ter’s Magic + Willpower. If the target prevails, they have escaped. If they fail, the Immobilized status remains until the next time they can attempt an escape.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Compulsion</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION M Major LOS Sustained This power enables the critter to compel a target to perform a specific action, even if that action might not be in the target’s best interests, including actions</p>
<p class="calibre1">harmful to themselves or others. The critter must make an Opposed test using its Magic + Charisma against the target’s Willpower + Logic; if the target loses, they must fulfill the compulsion on their next available action, before taking any other actions. The critter must sustain the power until the action is complete for it to work, but can choose to drop it at any time, releasing the target from the compulsion. The victim immediately recognizes that they were compelled to act after this power is used. This pow- er can’t be used to plant suggestions for future com- pelled actions; once the power is dropped or the task completed, the target’s mind is their own once again, along with the horror of what they just did.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Concealment</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Major LOS Sustained Critters with this power can mystically hide themselves, other people, or things that someone else is seeking. Concealment applies the Invisible (Improved) status equal to the critter’s Magic at- tribute. In combat, an Observe in Detail Major Action must be used to allow a Perception test to attempt to overcome the concealment. Success means the target is spotted by that character until the critter can hide again or the end of the charac- ter’s next player turn, whichever comes last. Concealment can be used simultaneously on a number of average metahuman-sized targets (Body up to 5; Body over 5 counts as 2 targets) equal to the critter’s Magic, or a number of much smaller targets (cats, babies, rats, etc.) equal to the critter’s Magic x 5. Concealed subjects can see each other if the critter allows it. The effect lasts until the critter stops sustaining the power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confusion</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION M Major LOS Sustained This power causes the target to become indeci- sive, forgetful, and befuddled. If the critter scores any net hits, the target character gains the Dazed status and the Confused status at a rating equal to the net hits. Any net hits the critter scores be- come a negative dice pool modifier for any action the target character takes, and the target gains the Dazed status.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Corrosive Spit</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Major LOS Instant The critter can project an extremely caustic substance as an attack. Make a ranged combat attack, using the critter’s Magic + Agility. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">WILD LIFE // POWERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">attack has a DV of (Magic)P (Chemical), Attack Ratings of Near (Magic x 2), Close (Magic x 2) &ndash; 2, Medium (Magic x 2) &ndash; 8, Far (Magic x 2) &ndash; 10. If the Attack Value drops to 0, the spit attack cannot reach those ranges.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dual Natured</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Auto Self Always Dual-natured critters are active on both the as- tral and physical plane at the same time. They can interact with both astral and physical beings. They perceive the astral plane similarly to characters us- ing astral perception (see The Astral Plane, p.&nbsp;159), but being dual natured is different from astral per- ception. Dual-natured critters always sense both the physical and astral planes, meaning their minds are accustomed to processing both astral and phys- ical sensations, so dual-natured critters don’t suf- fer the &ndash;2 dice pool modifier for interacting with the physical world while astrally perceiving.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elemental Attack</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Major LOS Instant Whether it’s a burst of flame, a spear of ice, a bolt of lightning, or a glob of caustic chemicals, a critter with this power can project a damaging bolt of ele- mental energy. The power is selected with a specific element type: Electricity, Fire, Chemical, or Cold. Make a ranged combat attack, using the critter’s Magic + Agility. The attack has a DV of (Magic)P (Damage Type), Attack Ratings of Near (Magic x 2), Close (Magic x 2) &ndash; 2, Medium (Magic x 2) &ndash; 8, Far (Magic x 2) &ndash; 10. If the Attack Rating drops to 0 or lower, the elemental attack cannot reach those rang- es. The target also gains the appropriate Status Effect for the attack type: Zapped (Electricity), Burning (Fire), Corroded (Chemical), or Chilled (Cold).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Energy Aura</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Auto Self Always This critter is surrounded by a field of damaging energy, which can take the form of fire, cold, elec- tricity, or a caustic brew of chemicals. The power is selected with a specific element type. The crit- ter adds its (Magic/2, rounded up) to the Damage Value of any Close Combat attack it makes. The damage inflicts the appropriate status&mdash;Zapped (Electricity), Burning (Fire), Corrosive (Chemical), Chilled (Cold)&mdash;and increases the Attack Rating by the critter’s Magic. Successful unarmed Close Combat attacks against a critter with Energy Aura also damage the attacker.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The attacker makes a Damage Resistance test against a DV equal to the critter’s (Magic)P and gains the appropriate Status tied to the energy type as above. Unless indicated in the critter’s description, this pow- er is always on and cannot be turned off.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Engulf</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Major Touch Sustained This power allows a critter to envelop a target within itself or the terrain it controls, smothering the target and causing damage. This is a Close Combat attack with a DV equal to (Magic)P (Dam- age Type) as well as specific effects by element, an increase to the Attack Value of +Magic, and the critter has engulfed its target in its grasp. Net hits on the Close Combat attack increase damage nor- mally, and the target gets a standard Damage Re- sistance test. Even if all the damage is resisted, the target is still engulfed. Once engulfed, a target suf- fers the Immobilized status. On its player turn, the critter automatically inflicts damage as above on an engulfed target and the target gets to resist each time as above. On the target’s player turn, they may use a Major Action to attempt escape by mak- ing an Opposed test, rolling the target’s Strength + Athletics against the critter’s Magic + Body. If the target wins, they escape and take no more damage from the attack. Some Engulf powers have second- ary effects, as described below. Air Engulf: The target resists Stun damage with a DV equal to (Magic + 2). If the victim passes out from Stun damage, they continue to take damage, with the Stun damage overflowing into Physical damage as normal. Victims gain the Fatigued I status. Earth Engulf: The target resists Physical damage with a DV equal to (Magic + 2). Victims gain the Fatigued I status. Fire Engulf: The victim resists Physical damage and gains the Burning status for as long as they are engulfed + 1 combat round. Water Engulf: The victim resists Stun with a DV of (Magic + 2). This is rougher than normal drown- ing, because the critter is capable of exerting great pressure on the victim. Victims who pass out from Stun damage continue to take damage after falling unconscious, with the Stun damage overflowing into Physical damage as normal. The victim suffers the Wet and Fatigued I statuses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enhanced Senses</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Auto Self Always This power includes any improved or aug- mented senses beyond the normal human range of awareness. This includes low-light and ther- mographic vision, improved hearing and smell,</p>
<p class="calibre1">223</p>
<p class="calibre1">POWERS // WILD LIFE</p>
<p class="calibre1">224</p>
<p class="calibre1">heat-sensing organs, natural sonar, and so on. The actual enhanced senses are specified in the descrip- tion. For the effects of the enhanced senses, locate their technological equivalent in the Gear chapter (p.&nbsp;275).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Essence Drain</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Major Touch Permanent This power allows a critter to permanently take away another being’s Essence and add it to its own. Essence Drain can only target physical, sapient beings (characters and non-astral critters with the Sapience power). The target must be naturally sapient, not made sapient through another power, magic, or tech. Essence can’t be drained while the victim is actively, physically resisting. They must either be willing or subdued (restrained, paralyzed, mentally controlled, etc.). Essence transfer can only take place through a strong emotional connection, whether that emotion is passion, anger, or terror. The emotion must also be focused on the critter using the power. Abstract terror is not enough; the victim must be specifically terrified of his attacker in order for the attacker to drain the victim’s Essence. Though there is often a transfer of living material involved in an Essence Drain attack (a vampire drinking their victim’s blood, for instance), nothing but the emotional connection is actually re- quired for this power to work. Draining a point of Essence takes a Charisma + Magic (10 &ndash; target’s Es- sence, 1 minute) Extended test. Victims suffer the Fa- tigued Status Effect equal to the number of Essence points drained. If the critter is disturbed or interrupted before this test ends, the Essence point is not drained. Lost Essence affects a target character’s Magic or Reso- nance Rating (see Essence, p.&nbsp;38). If a target charac- ter’s Essence is drained to 0, the character dies. A critter can only increase its Essence to twice its natural maximum. Any Essence drained beyond this point is lost. A critter that drains Essence can pump their stolen life force into other attributes, including Magic, with a Minor Action. Every point of Es- sence spent may temporarily boost one Physical or Mental attribute, or Magic, by 1. Multiple points of Essence can be pumped into a single attribute if so desired, but only one point can be moved per Minor Action. The maximum boost an attribute can receive in this fashion is 4. This attribute boost wears off after 12 hours, and the Essence points used to fuel the boost are lost.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fear</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION M Major LOS Special This power allows a critter to fill its victim with</p>
<p class="calibre1">overwhelming terror. The victim flees in panic and doesn’t stop until they are safely away and out of the critter’s sight, at which point they gain both the Panicked and Frightened statuses. The critter makes an Opposed test using its Willpower + Mag- ic against the target’s Willpower + Logic. The terror lasts for 1 combat round per net hit scored by the critter, while the status lasts double that number of combat rounds. Even once the fear fades, the target must succeed in a Willpower + Logic (Critter’s Mag- ic/2) test to gather the nerve to face the critter again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Guard</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Major LOS Sustained This power allows the critter to protect against the Accident power and glitches caused by dice rolls. Guard may be used on a number of targets at once equal to the critter’s Magic attribute. When under the Guard power, critical glitches are down- graded to glitches and glitches are simply failures, unless the Accident power is in use, and then the Guard power simply cancels the effects of Accident and all is normal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardened Armor</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Auto Self Always This power is the reason you don’t hunt drag- ons with a heavy pistol. This power provides its rating as an addition to Defense Rating. It also provides its rating as automatic hits on the Dam- age Resistance test. Finally, if the modified Damage Value of an attack is less than the Hardened Armor rating, the attack does no damage. Don’t make a Damage Resistance test for the critter, as the attack bounces harmlessly off its hide. The attacker is al- lowed to be annoyed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardened Mystic Armor</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION M Auto Self Always This power provides protection from all attacks on the astral plane, including spells and critter powers. Otherwise, it functions in the same way as Hardened Armor, above.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Immunity</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Auto Self Always A critter with Immunity has an enhanced resis- tance to a certain type of attack or affliction. Ef- fectively, the critter has a Hardened Armor with a rating equal to its Essence against that particular</p>
<p class="calibre1">WILD LIFE // POWERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind of damage (see Hardened Armor, above). Immunity to Age: This immunity halts the ef- fects of aging, effectively making the being with it immortal … unless they live a dangerous life. Immunity to Normal Weapons: This applies to all attacks that are not magical in nature; weapon foci, spells, and adept or critter powers function normally. If the critter also has the Allergy or Vul- nerability weakness, then the Immunity does not apply against non-magical attacks made using the allergen or vulnerability.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Infection</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Auto Touch Permanent This power is the vector by which the hu- man-metahuman vampiric virus (HMHVV) is transmitted. When a critter with this power uses Essence Drain on a victim, this power attempts to pass the critter’s own infection on to the victim when Essence is drained to 0. To see if the victim is Infected, make an Opposed test of the critter’s Magic x 2 against the victim’s Body + Willpower. If the critter wins, the victim is Infected and enters a coma-like state as the virus reshapes the victim physically, mentally, and spiritually. Twenty-four hours later, the victim rises as a new Infected crit- ter (as determined by its original metaspecies) with a single point of Essence and an insatiable, bestial hunger for more. The new Infected critter must do everything in its power to use the Essence Drain power on the first source it finds. Player characters transformed through the In- fection power automatically become NPCs when they enter their coma and are controlled by the gamemaster from that point forward (for now, mwahahahahaha).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Influence</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION M Major LOS Instant This power gives the critter the ability to im- plant a suggestion in the target’s mind. Make a Magic + Charisma vs.&nbsp;Willpower + Logic Opposed test. If the critter succeeds, its target acts on the suggestion as if it were their own idea. If the target is confronted with the wrongness of the suggestion (such as “shoot your spouse in the face”), the sub- ject can make a Willpower (critter’s Magic) test to overcome it. Any hits on this test allow a dice-pool penalty on whatever action must be performed. If the character fails at the Willpower test, Edge Boosts and Actions can be used in reverse, i.e., 4 Edge to subtract your Edge from your dice pool or 5 Edge to create an event like the gun jamming.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Innate Spell</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION As spell Major As spell As spell This power allows the critter to cast a single, spe- cific spell. To use this power effectively, the critter has to have the Sorcery skill, but if they don’t, they can simply roll Magic with no penalty. Innate Spells come from the list of spells cast by magicians and can be opposed with Counterspelling actions. In- nate Spells also produce drain as normal and cause a &ndash;2 penalty on actions when they are sustained. Critters and spirits resist drain with Willpower + In- tuition or Charisma (whichever is higher).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Materialization</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION M Major Self Sustained This power allows astral beings to take shape in the physical world and form a temporary “body” to inhabit while they’re here. This lets them inter- act with, and affect, physical beings. Their form pulls from local resources appropriate to the type of spirit but never creates loopholes to be manipu- lated, like summoning a spirit to remove a section of wall to make its physical form. Additionally, they gain Immunity to Normal Weapons while ma- terialized. Materializing requires a Major Action, while dematerializing to return to the astral plane requires a Minor Action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimicry</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Minor Self Sustained This power allows a critter to imitate sounds perfectly, including speech and the hunting calls of other creatures to which the mimicking critter has been exposed. Noticing that the mimicked sound is false requires a Perception + Intuition + vs.&nbsp;Charis- ma + Magic Opposed test.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mindspeech</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION M Auto LOS Instant Some sapient critters, for example dragons, don’t have complex vocal cords. These critters are able to communicate telepathically with beings within their line of sight using this power. Lan- guage barriers do not inhibit the power. This tele- pathic communication can’t be detected by techno- logical means, so critters communicating this way using modern technology must employ a “transla- tor” to speak for them. This power lets the critter project speech, but the targets cannot respond the same way without their own telepathic ability.</p>
<p class="calibre1">225</p>
<p class="calibre1">POWERS // WILD LIFE</p>
<p class="calibre1">226</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mist Form</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Major Self Sustained This power allows the critter to transform it- self into a cloud of mist. Shifting into and out of mist form are both Major Actions. When shifting into mist form, the critter transforms itself and any bonded foci it is carrying, active or not. The mist form has a movement rate of five meters per Move action or about six kilometers per hour; the critter can control some of its movement in this form, though it is susceptible to wind speeds great- er than its movement speed when moving against them. These can push or disrupt the mist, which can temporarily disorient the critter. The mist form can pass through any cracks or crevices as long as they are not airtight. Systems that defend against gases, bacteria, or viral infiltration will stop a crit- ter in mist form. While in mist form, the critter has Immunity to Normal Weapons but is considered to have a moderate Allergy to Fire. If the being is exposed to a substance to which it is allergic or vulnerable, it is immediately forced back into its normal form. While in mist form, the critter can perceive normally but cannot use any of its other powers until it resumes its normal form.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Movement</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Major LOS Sustained This power allows the critter to speed up or slow down the target’s movement rate. The pow- er only works on things that are predisposed to locomotion, namely vehicles, characters, or crit- ters. The critter can multiply or divide the target’s movement by up to its Magic attribute. For unwilling targets, the critter makes an op- posed test using its Magic + Willpower against the target’s Logic + Willpower. The critter can multiply or divide the target’s movement by up to its net hits or Magic attribute, whichever is lower. Using Movement on vehicles is tougher than it is on critters and characters. If the target is a ve- hicle, the critter makes a Magic + Willpower test with a threshold of half the vehicle’s Body (round up, minimum of 2). If the critter meets the thresh- old, add the hits to the vehicle’s Acceleration attri- bute and then add the result to (or subtract it from) the vehicle’s Speed in the next Combat Round, as if accelerating or decelerating the vehicle. The critter can continue to make Magic + Willpower tests to increase or decrease the vehicle’s speed each com- bat round that it sustains this power and the ve- hicle remains in its domain/terrain. Based on the situation, these sudden changes in speed may call for Crash tests (p.&nbsp;200) or a Piloting test for the vehicle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mystic Armor</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION M Auto Self Always This power functions in the same way as Ar- mor, except that it only provides protection from attacks on the astral plane.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Natural Weapon</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Auto Touch Instant Teeth. Claws. A spiked tail. Whatever shape it takes, this critter possesses some means of inflicting Physical damage. The description of this power de- scribes the nature of the attack, as well as its Damage, Attack Rating, and appropriate stats. Natural weap- ons may be either Close Combat or ranged attacks, and critters follow standard combat rules when using them. Critters use the Close Combat skill to attack with melee weapons, and the Exotic Weapons skill to attack with ranged weapons. Natural weapons are considered normal for purposes of the Immunity to Normal Weapons power; exceptions are noted in in- dividual critter descriptions. A dual-natured critter with a Close Combat Natural Weapon can use it against astral targets that are within its reach. Use the critter’s normal Close Combat skill and physical Damage Value (typically Strength / 2 unless otherwise noted) for this attack. Ranged Natural Weapons, like other ranged combat options, do not work on the astral plane. Critters without a Natural Weapon may still make a Close Combat attack with attributes de- fined on the critter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Noxious Breath</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Major Special Instant This power can incapacitate targets with a nau- seating stench. This is treated as a Spray Ranged Attack (p.&nbsp;117) using the critter’s Agility + Magic, with an Attack Rating of Near (Magic x 2), Close (Magic), Medium &mdash;, Far &mdash;, Extreme &mdash;. The at- tributes for the toxin attack are Vector: Inhalation, Speed: Immediate, Power: critter’s Magic, Effect: Stun damage, Dazed, Nauseated). Armor is useless against this attack, but an active chemical seal op- erates as normal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Paralyzing Howl</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Major Special Special This power causes targets to slow or stiffen up. It affects everyone who hears it within a radius of (Magic x 15) meters around the howling creature,</p>
<p class="calibre1">WILD LIFE // POWERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the exception of other critters with the same power. The critter makes a Magic + Charisma vs.&nbsp;Intuition + Willpower Opposed test. The rating of any area-effect sound-dampening devices, person- al sound-dampening devices (such as cyberware, or earbuds with sound dampening), or hits scored by Hush or Silence spells, is added to the target’s Opposed test, with only the highest single modifier applying. If the target wins, they suffer no ill ef- fects. If the critter wins, the target gains the Immo- bilized status. If the critter gets 4 or more net hits, the target gains the Paralyzed status.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Paralyzing Touch</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Major Touch Special This is the Touch-range version of the Paralyz- ing Howl power. The critter must touch the target; if the target is surprised or otherwise unaware of the critter, this is an automatic hit. If the target is aware of the critter, treat this as a Close Combat attack that causes no damage. The critter then makes an Agility + Magic vs.&nbsp;Reaction + Willpow- er Opposed test. The effect is the same as Paralyz- ing Howl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Petrification</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Major LOS Sustained This is the unfun way of getting stoned. The critter makes a Magic + Intuition vs.&nbsp;Reaction + Willpower Opposed test. If the critter wins, the tar- get suffers the Immobilized status. If the critter gets 4 or more net hits, the target gains the Petrified sta- tus. Repeated attacks with this power accumulate net hits between attacks. While transformed, the victim is unaware of their surroundings and events happening around them. This power is often used over and over to keep slowing a target until they are petrified.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychokinesis</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Minor LOS Sustained This power enables a critter to move an object with its mind. The invisible “hand” has Strength and Agility equal to the number of hits scored on a Magic + Willpower Test, can move 10 meters per combat round, and can make a Close Combat or Ranged Attack with the appropriate skill of the critter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Regeneration</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Auto Self Always This power allows rapid healing of any dam- age a critter has taken. At the end of each com- bat round, if the critter has any damage at all, it makes a Magic + Body test, adds its Body to the number of hits scored, and heals that many box- es of damage, first from Overflow boxes, then from the Physical Condition Monitor, and final- ly from the Stun Condition Monitor. If the crit- ter has exceeded its maximum Overflow boxes, it’s not dead yet. It still gets a Regeneration test. If, after this test, its Overflow boxes still exceed its (Body x 2), then it’s really dead. Regeneration can’t heal everything. Damage to the brain via a called shot to the head (&ndash;10 dice pool modifier), magical damage from weapon foci, damage from a Vulnerability, and damage from drain can’t be healed by Regeneration. If the crit- ter is damaged by something it has an Allergy to, it can heal the damage, but it can’t make a Regenera- tion test as long as it is in contact with the allergen. Regeneration is incompatible with augmenta- tions. Critters with Regeneration cannot receive augmentations, as surgical incisions close too quickly to perform the implantation. Critters with augmentations who gain this power will reject their augmentations as the power repairs their ex- isting genetic template.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sapience</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Auto Self Always Sapient critters are self-aware, no longer pri- marily driven by instinct, and generally at or above the level of Homo sapiens. Most critters are considered unaware, meaning they can’t make tests involving skills they don’t possess, but sapi- ent critters are merely Untrained (see p.&nbsp;93). They are also capable of learning new skills if they so choose. Most sapient critters are mundane, but they are capable of Awakening or Emerging and possess- ing a Magic or Resonance attribute. These special sapient critters are capable of learning Magic and Resonance-based skills and follow the same rules as normal characters.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Search</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Major Special Special You can find your lost keys really fast with this power. To find a target, the critter makes a Magic + Intuition (5, 10 minutes) Extended test. Lots of</p>

<p class="calibre1">228</p>
<p class="calibre1">things can make this harder; apply the appropriate threshold modifiers from the Search Modifiers table. The critter must have seen the thing it’s search- ing for at some point before the search begins. Spirits may search for anything for which their summoner can provide them a mental image. Crit- ters who can enter astral space may use this power there but still need to materialize while searching for an inanimate target in the physical world. Liv- ing things with auras can be searched for from the astral plane.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Venom</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Auto Touch Instant The critter secretes a toxin (see p.&nbsp;122) that is dangerous and harmful to others. Typically, the attributes for this poison are Vector: Injection; Speed: 1 combat round; Power: Magic; Effect: Dazed, Poisoned (Magic)P. Some critters may have venoms with different attributes, such as a Con- tact vector, that will be noted in their individual descriptions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weather Control</p>
<p class="calibre1">TYPE ACTION RANGE DURATION P Major LOS Sustained This allows a critter to manipulate, within rea- son, certain local weather conditions. The desired weather must be realistically possible in the envi- ronment. It builds up over time, reaching its peak when the critter completes a Magic + Willpower (10, 30 minutes) Extended Test. In spite of the power’s name, the critter only summons condi- tions and moves them in the desired direction. A critter can summon a thunderstorm, for instance, but can’t aim the lightning bolts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">WEAKNESSES Not all mysterious powers are helpful to a crit- ter. Here are some of the weaknesses the creatures of the Sixth World can suffer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Allergy Like characters, many critters suffer allergies to particular substances or conditions. Treat this weakness as the Allergy negative quality (p.&nbsp;74).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dietary Requirement A critter with this weakness has to include some strange or exotic substance in their diet. Typical examples include toxic waste, petroleum, gold, or metahuman flesh. Unless specified in the critter’s description, the critter needs at least one meal per day, appropriate to its size and metabolism. Each day it misses the requirement, it suffers a cumula- tive &ndash;2 dice pool penalty on all actions, and their Body attribute drops by 1. If their Body reaches 0, they die.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Essence Loss Certain critters, most notably the Infected, have no actual Essence of their own; they exist by stealing Essence from other beings. Not only do they not have their own Essence, they slowly lose any Essence they’ve stolen, at the rate of 1 point of Essence every lunar month at the new moon. Losing Essence also means that a critter’s Magic might be affected (see p.&nbsp;38). If the critter is reduced to an Essence score of 0, it’s living on borrowed time. It will die a very unpleasant death in Body + Willpower days unless it feeds and replenishes its Essence. Such a critter is a starving predator in search of prey for suste- nance, and as such is extraordinarily dangerous. Certain powers of the HMHVV Infected accel- erate Essence Loss. Any critter power that is not automatic (meaning it requires an action to use) is Essence-intensive for the Infected. Each use of these powers accelerates the loss of Essence by one week.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Induced Dormancy Some condition or substance can force some critters into a coma-like state of suspended anima- tion. The condition can be a lack of air or exposure to a certain rare substance such as orichalcum. The length of exposure needed to cause the critter to become dormant varies and is mentioned in the critter’s description. The critter will awaken quick- ly, usually within a minute, once the condition or substance is removed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reduced Senses Any or all of the critter’s five basic senses may be limited in effectiveness. Typically, reduced sens- es function at half the normal range or effective- ness, but they might be reduced even further, pos- sibly to the point of the complete loss of that sense as noted in the critter description.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Uneducated Treat this weakness as the Uneducated negative quality (p.&nbsp;79).</p>
<p class="calibre1">WILD LIFE // POWERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vulnerability Some critters have an exploitable weakness, something that hurts them more than other things, or against which they have no defense. Sometimes it’s a substance. This substance, be it wood or gold or ferrocrete, causes additional damage when used as a weapon against the critter. Increase the Dam- age Value of all attacks with the substance by the critter’s Magic attribute or 3, whichever it higher.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weapons made of something the critter is vulnera- ble to bypass any Immunities it might have. Damage taken from the substance to which a critter is vul- nerable can’t be healed by Regeneration or healing magic, only by natural healing. Some Vulnerabilities are conditions, not substances. For instance, a bas- ilisk is vulnerable to its own Petrification power. In such cases, a dice pool modifier is applied to the critter’s Resistance test to avoid the condition equal to its Magic attribute or &ndash;3, whichever is higher.</p>

<p class="calibre1">POWERS // WILD LIFE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Are you ready to manage the chaos of the Sixth World and throw others into it? Then, let’s do this, chummer! Welcome to the Sixth World! For any gamemaster (abbreviated GM), wheth- er you’re a first-timer or a veteran GM of many years, the task of running a game for your play- ers can seem daunting when you’re dealing with a new rule set. And that’s okay. Being the GM for a game can be very complex, requiring the balanc- ing of several game concepts and elements at the same time, all while trying to keep the game fun and interesting for the players. It’s a lot to take in and process. But then, it can also be a fantastic experience unlike any other&mdash;which is why you’ll keep coming back! So the first piece of advice is to prepare as if people will have fun, because most likely, they will. Note that this information and advice is flexible enough to be applied to a wide range of Shadow- run adventures, campaigns, home games, or gener- al gaming sessions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What the Frag Does a GM Do? Glad you asked! In Shadowrun, the GM fulfills several critical roles during a gaming session. First and foremost, they’re a storyteller for the players and their characters. A GM is responsible for setting up and maintaining the session’s narra- tive or story, which in turn gives the players some- thing to do and experience. Now, these stories can be something original that the GM created, or something they’re working from, such as a pre-gen- erated adventure or a series of interconnected ad- ventures known as a campaign. Either way, it’s up to the GM to get their players from the beginning to the end&mdash;along with every side-trip, detour, obsta- cle, and plot twist encountered along the way&mdash;of whatever they’re running, be it a simple scenario, a more complex adventure, or whatever. But let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves! While different GMs will develop their own style</p>
<p class="calibre1">RUNNING THE GAME //</p>
<p class="calibre1">of running games over time, it’s still up to them to get and keep their players interested in playing the game by presenting the story or situation to them. They are the main point of contact between the players and the Sixth World of Shadowrun.</p>
<p class="calibre1">FIND YOUR GM STYLE The cyberpunk-fantasy dystopia of Shadowrun is a vi- brant universe full of excitement and possibilities in endless combinations for both players and GMs. The basic level of GM activity is setting the stage for the players, offering ba- sic, bare-bones descriptions of what’s going on and how ad- versaries will react to the players or how they can overcome obstacles. This is a good start. Or a GM can offer a more immersive experience, complete with detailed descrip- tions of the situation, setting, opposition, interactions with non-player characters, and most importantly: the action! They can also do things like incorporate maps or figures of some kind to represent the player’s characters. The right ambient music can also bring the mood, as can additional images of gear, locations, and people you show the players from a tablet. Some GMs require players to remain in-char- acter for the entire session. Or any combination of the above ideas listed. The trick is to find a method of running a game (or GMing) that works not only for you but also satisfies your players.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Second, the GM is a combination of adversary, ally, and guide to their players. In Shadowrun&mdash;or any RPG for that matter&mdash;the GM controls every- thing in the game setting that the players and their characters will encounter. This includes but is not limited to: enemies to fight, obstacles to overcome, and potential allies, neutral parties, or items that may aid the players. At any given time, the GM is both trying to hurt and help the players. Any characters within the game that are not the player characters (PCs) are known as non-player charac- ters (NPCs), and they can be anyone or anything the GM needs. All NPCs are under the GM’s di- rect control, unless there are special circumstances. Additionally, a GM is responsible for guiding the PCs through the game&mdash;not just with regard to the game plot or narrative, but also when it comes to game rules and concepts. For example, players, especially new ones, can sometimes get stuck or frustrated during a game because of something rule-related. They may forget how a game mechan- ic works and need help figuring it out. Or they may have forgotten an important rule that could have serious repercussions for them, their team, or even the adventure as a whole. Or they may find them- selves in a situation where they feel stuck with no apparent way out. It’s ultimately the GM’s job to decide how best to deal with a situation, both in and out of game. Third, the GM is the referee and ultimate au- thority in the game. Not only is the GM responsi-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ble for moving the story along, providing a chal- lenge/experience for the players, and everything listed above, they’re also the supreme arbiter re- garding game rules during a game session. This means that when there’s question regarding rules interpretation, or when a situation inevitably aris- es that is not specifically covered in said rules, or when applying the rules in any given game situ- ation, the GM has the ultimate final say on how things proceed. However, GMs must be judicious and cautious in doing so. After all, the game is all about making sure everyone has fun.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Use, Don’t Abuse, Your Authority One of the biggest points of contention between play- ers and their GM is often the interpretation of rules. This usually doesn’t cover basic/core game mechanics (e.g., how to shoot a gun, cast a spell, punch someone in the face), but instead comes into play during circumstances such as “How would X factor affect Y in this situation?” Such issues are only exacerbated when a PC is facing death or, even worse, if there’s a disagreement between GM and player regarding a rule interpretation or imple- mentation. Gamemasters are responsible for finding a solution or making a final ruling. And in doing so, a GM can sometimes be or perceived as being heavy-handed or power-tripping, either of which can disrupt or even ruin a game if the situation is mishandled. There are multiple ways a GM can try to defuse the situation, such as agree- ing to a temporary compromise and doing more rule re- search later to keep the game moving. It’s recommended that GMs be even-handed in their rulings and never bla- tantly use their authority unfairly against their players. The GM gets the final call, but they also need to help ev- eryone have fun, rather than just try to make rulings that make life easier for them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prepping For a Game One of the fastest ways for GMs, especially new ones, to bring their game to a screeching halt is to do little or no preparation for it. While every GM eventually develops their own game-running style, there are a few basics that everyone should follow, no matter what your skill level and experience are.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prep Point Number One: Know Your Adventure If a GM has their own original or home-grown adventure, they should have at least a basic idea or outline of how the adventure plays out. While a GM doesn’t have to have every minute detail writ-</p>
<p class="calibre1">231</p>
<p class="calibre1">PREPPING FOR A GAME // RUNNING THE GAME</p>
<p class="calibre1">232</p>
<p class="calibre1">ten down (although that can be helpful for some), at least know where the players will start and where you want them to end. But when running a pre-gen- erated (pre-gen) adventure, a GM should always read the adventure first. Doing so not only helps keep the game flowing, but also allows a GM to identify potential problems or obstacles that may come up. For example, an adventure with heavy combat may not be the adventure for a group or runner team with little to no combat skills. Know- ing this, a GM may elect to change the adventure or scenario a bit to better conform to a team’s dynam- ic. And speaking of a shadowrunner team …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prep Point Number Two: Know What Your Players Are Bringing to the Table! While this one may not always be possible, it’s highly recommended that a GM know what char- acters their players are bringing to the table before the game session begins. If the players are bringing in original characters, the GM is better able to help their players play said characters and answer ques- tions that inevitably come up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">GAME ITEMS Playing Shadowrun, or any RPG for that matter, can seem quite involved and require a lot of materials. But when you get down to it, a session can be played with just a few items: dice for both GM and players, character sheets for the players, and writing utensils of some kind to keep track of changes in a PC’s status, such as ammo expenditure or wounds. Other items such as rulebooks and other game book supplements can also be helpful for both player and GM during a game. Other miscellaneous items such as notebooks, notepads, or even simple piec- es of scratch paper can also be extremely handy but are not strictly necessary. For the beginning GM, it’s best to have as much material as you think you’ll need at first. Experience will eventually reveal what is necessary for a game session.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prep Point Number Three: Have Materials Ready to Go If a GM is making their own adventure, make sure to have adventure notes, maps, stats for ad- versaries, and all that fun stuff ready to go. It will make running a game much easier! If running a pre-gen, have a copy of the adventure handy on either a device of some kind, or a good old-fash- ioned paper book.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prep Point Number Four: Know What the Players Want &amp; Expect There are a lot of different ways to play Shad- owrun. Some groups like to roleplay as stone-cold professionals, out to do a job and collect a pay- check. Others are forces of chaos, always happy to gum up the works of society while proceeding in a wild, over-the-top fashion. Still others are forces of justice in an unjust world, knowing they can’t fix everything but ready to fix what they can. Some groups emphasize story, others detailed action. Some like detailed planning, others like to charge in and fly by the seat of their pants. Take some time to find out player preferences and then make the game work for them. Not everyone in a group may like the same elements in a game, so it will take work to give everyone a chance to en- joy their favorite parts. There’s work to do by the players, too&mdash;they have to help each other get to the parts of the game they like and be patient while they wait to get to their own favorite parts. Finally, have a conversation with players about what game elements they’re comfortable with. How violent should the game be or not be? Should romance be part of the roleplaying environment? What about sex? Are there elements of the game world that might be too close to individuals’ real- life trauma, and thus would best be avoided? There is no way to know these things without talking about them, so rather than be caught by surprise, talk about these things openly so that the ongoing game can function in a place where players will have fun.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Glitches and Critical Glitches Glitches and critical glitches present prime op- portunities for gamemasters to add flavor, excite- ment, and plot twists to your Shadowrun game. That doesn’t mean it’s easy to come up with glitches on the fly, so we’re here to help&mdash;the Glitch Table has a bunch of glitch and critical glitch suggestions for a wide variety of Shadowrun situations. Note that they tend to get more severe as you get farther to the right.</p>

<p class="calibre1">The spirit arrives free but connects itself to you spiritually. It feeds off your Essence (dropping Magic as well) unless you help it find Essence to sustain itself.

<p class="calibre1">Rather than a single spirit arriving, you rip a gateway between the material plane and the home plane of the spirit you are summoning. The gateway has a Force 3 times the Force of the spirit you were trying to summon and provides access for spirits of that type up to that Force while open. To close the gateway, you must banish it as if it had a number of net hits equal to its Force. A group of 1D6 spirits tag along with the one you summoned. They all come across connected to the summoner but go wild once on our plane. This means they’re all connected to the summoner’s aura, and their activities can be tracked to them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Summoning error (spirit resists as if double the expected Force).</p>
<p class="calibre1">All good! Just kidding. The spirit you summon pretends to be all good but acts freely and seeks to gain freedom. Once free, it fulfills its own desires and mission (up to the GM) but carries the summoner’s signature.</p>

<p class="calibre1">be evenly distributed throughout the team&mdash;one individual’s good or bad decisions do not neces- sarily carry over to all their teammates. Guide- lines for Reputation increases and decreases are in the Reputation Changes table, but of necessity these involve a fair amount of gamemaster dis- cretion&mdash;in the end, the gamemaster has to judge whether particular actions were noticed enough to have some sort of impact, and what that im- pact might be. These do not, of course, cover every situation that might affect a runner’s Reputation, meaning the table is more a guideline than a definitive listing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kept a long-standing promise without payment +1 Defused potentially violent situation +1 Rescued a popular, famous person from peril +2</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reputation can contribute to Heat modifiers (see below) and may also affect social interac- tions. When your Reputation is +10 or higher, you gain an Edge at the beginning of social interac- tions with law enforcement, normal community residents, and other runners. When you are in- teracting with hardened criminals, whether orga- nized or otherwise, they gain an Edge due to their</p>
<p class="calibre1">REPUTATION AND HEAT // RUNNING THE GAME</p>
<p class="calibre1">236</p>
<p class="calibre1">lack of respect for you. When it is &ndash;10 or lower the reverse is true&mdash;law enforcements, commu- nity residents, and other residents gain an Edge at the beginning of a social interaction with you, while you gain a point of Edge at the beginning of social interactions with hardened criminals, orga- nized and otherwise.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Heat Heat is a statistic that measures how much pres- sure, from law enforcement and otherwise, shad- owrunners are feeling. Since the runners are usual- ly committing some sort of crime, there is always a chance of the Heat on them increasing. At the end of every game session, the gamemaster rolls 2D6; on a roll of 9 or more, all runners increase their Heat score by 1. If the total is 15 or more (see Heat Modifiers and the Heat Modifiers Table for how this could happen), all runners increase their Heat score by 2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Heat modifiers The nature of a job, along with the runners’ ap- proach to it, helps decide how likely they are to</p>
<p class="calibre1">heat modifiers table</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase the Heat on them&mdash;and they might even gain a reward through clever tactics: These negative modifiers should be combined with the positive ones to get an overall Heat mod- ifier before the gamemaster rolls the Heat check. If the overall Heat modifier is &ndash;4 or lower, then it is impossible for the Heat check to succeed. So rather than make a roll, the gamemaster awards the run- ners +1 Reputation apiece to reward their skill in doing their work on the down-low. Note the different thresholds for when Reputa- tion works for you and works against you. As is the way in the world, a bad Reputation haunts you even if you’re keeping good company, while a good Reputation can be spoiled by the people with whom you work. It may not be fair or just, but that’s how perceptions often work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Heat Applications The effects of Heat are shown in the Heat Ef- fects table. When a group of runners have different Heat ratings, use the highest one.</p>

<p class="calibre1">The runners are on a Most Wanted list of law enforcement, one of the Big Ten, or a major nation, meaning they regularly have to avoid pursuit by those personnel. This pursuit may happen across national and corporate borders, depending on international/intercorporate agreements.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Lowering Heat As the Heat on you mounts, it’s only natural to want to bring it down before things get really intense. Luckily, there are a few methods available to players.</p>

<p class="calibre1">The runners provided sufficient bribes to keep things quiet 1 The runners made or used a connection in law enforcement who will help keep the heat off 1 The runners have sufficient goodwill to overcome rumors about their involvement in bad events 1 Team has one or more runners with a Reputation under &ndash;5 and no runners above 5 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Work a Contact To use this option, a player needs to have a Con- tact in law enforcement or corporate security with a Connection rating of 3 or higher. They can ask a major favor of that Contact&mdash;burying part of their record, smoothing things over with a superior, that sort of thing. This costs them some social capital with the Contact, and the Contact’s Loyalty rating is reduced by 1. In exchange, the player with the Contact, and any other players they wish to extend the benefit to, reduce their Heat by 2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">RUNNING THE GAME // REPUTATION AND HEAT</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pay a Bribe This is the way the world works! Money greases the wheels of … well, everything. For every 1,000 nuyen spent in bribes, 1 point of Heat is eliminated. Each 2,000 nuyen bribe only affects the Heat rating of a single person, but multiples of 1,000 can be spent to spread the reductions around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lie Low You don’t take work for a time to let the Heat dissipate. For every in-universe month you do no shadowrunning work, your Heat drops by 1. The maximum reduction you can gain from this is 3 in a single in-game year.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Find a Fall Guy This option requires a little more creativity by the players and judgment by the gamemas- ter. The runners can attempt to pin the blame for one of their past crimes on someone else. This will involve some Con tests, and possibly Stealth or other related tests to get evidence in the right place and to make people believe the story they’re selling. The Heat reduction from</p>
<p class="calibre1">this action is variable based on the actions but should be at least 3. Note that if Heat is lowered to 10, the effect of that level does not trigger again at that point. If it is lowered to 9 or lower, the effect listed with 10 Heat triggers again when 10 Heat is hit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Advanced Heat The basic model of Heat involves a single rat- ing to cover all the ways the players might attract heat, but gamemasters can opt to give the players multiple Heat ratings based on the different types of organizations that might get angry with the players. There are lots of ways to make multiple categories of Heat&mdash;it could be by type of organization (law enforcement, organized crime, corps, governments), by geographic region, or granular enough to be by specific corps and nations. The gamemaster can design the system that suits them or keep it simple with a single Heat rating for each player. If multiple Heat ratings are used, then the roll at the end of a gaming session only adds Heat to organizations or categories involved in that par- ticular run. For example, if players are running in Seattle and the gamemaster is categorizing Heat geographically, an increase in Heat at the end of a session would increase their North America Heat rating but not the rating on any other continent. As more Heat categories are used, gamemasters should shrink the ranges used on the Heat Effects table. The ranges could switch from 1 to 3, 4 to 6, etc. to 1 to 2, 3 to 4, etc., or even just have a single number at each level.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gaining Contacts Contacts can help runners on almost any part of the job, so managing them is an important part of a gamemaster’s work. As in most aspects of gamemastering, there is a balance to walk&mdash;the gamemaster does not want to be so stingy that the players see no progress in making and cultivating connections, but not so generous that they walk away with a connection to, say, the great drag- on Lofwyr after a couple of runs. Here are some guidelines in awarding and improving contacts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Contacts should be close to the same scale as the players The Skill Levels table on p.&nbsp;98 shows how char- acters’ skills are viewed in comparison to their field; this can be used with the description of the Connection ratings on p.&nbsp;51 to help see whether the circles in which the players operate would be at all similar. For example, at skill level 4 (profes- sional), a character might well interact with gang leaders and even mayors, but Connection ratings above 7 would likely be out of their reach. Even</p>
<p class="calibre1">237</p>
<p class="calibre1">GAINING CONTACTS // RUNNING THE GAME</p>
<p class="calibre1">238</p>
<p class="calibre1">if they did meet such people, it would be rare for them to become a contact of someone at skill level 4, since high-Connection helps don’t need to add more lower-skilled people to their virtual rolodex- es&mdash;an executive at a multinational corp has a ton of people of that skill level to call on, and they’re not necessarily looking for more people like that who will be asking them for favors all too soon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Characters need to do something significant to earn a Contact Earning a contact is not just about introducing yourself, or slipping a bartender twenty nuyen. Characters need to do something of value&mdash;com- pleting a run successfully and honestly, preventing serious harm to a person or someone they care about, or showing significant potential as a busi- ness partner are the sorts of activities that could earn a contact. The higher the Connection rating of the contact, the more the character should be doing to earn them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Characters should be active in building Loyalty Use the game to encourage the characters to earn more Loyalty from a contact. Have the con- tact reach out for favors, or put the contact in a tough spot so the characters need to do something to help them. Loyalty is useful not only in helping the characters get free information, but it also can be helpful in reducing the Heat on characters (see p.&nbsp;236). Give the characters a chance to build up Loyalty so they have it when they need it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Use the sample Contacts on p.&nbsp;211, and also build your own The sample contacts are a great starting point, but don’t hesitate to build your own contacts as the runners meet a variety of people. The range of personalities in the Sixth World help make it dis- tinct and give it flavor, so make contacts that give spice to the setting you’re building and the story you’re telling.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Security, Sensors, and Scanners When it comes to putting obstacles in front of players, remember that the biggest goal of the game is to have fun, and players tend to have the most fun when they are confronted with tasks that are achievable but not easy. Challenging them without overwhelming them is the underlying guidance for any security situations you throw them into. One of the critical laws to remember in Shad- owrun is Newton’s third law, which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reac-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tion. Or if we want to put it in bowdlerized Broad- way musical terms, anything you can do, security can do, and often better. The player characters will have certain strengths, but as a gamemaster you always have at least two options when it comes to planning obstacles for them. First, remember that there are lots of ways to get things done in the Sixth World, so finding an approach that is different from the characters’ strengths can keep them challenged. Second, you can always match strength to strength, and have someone equally skilled go toe-to-toe with the characters to see who will be the last one standing. When designing a security setup, remember all the ways players can be attacked&mdash;in melee com- bat, at range, by magic, by astral spirits, through the Matrix, and so on. If players are cruising through a scenario too quickly, find a weak spot and go after it. If they’re struggling too much, put out some obstacles that are designed to be defeated by their strengths.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Security Zone Ratings The Professional Ratings of grunts are useful tools in determining what kind of security can be deployed, and security zone ratings provide the same sort of guidance. While gamemasters can al- ways adjust circumstances as necessary, these rat- ings provide a look at the different sorts of securi- ty that runners might encounter, providing a quick snapshot of the sort of setup a gamemaster can provide when runners try to get to where they’re not supposed to be. The ratings can apply to neighborhoods, develop- ments, or a single building, and they are as follows:</p>
<p class="calibre1">security rating Z There is no organized security in a Z zone, mainly because there usually isn’t anything of worth. Cops don’t patrol Z zones and won’t re- spond to calls to crimes in those areas. Even gangs don’t provide informal security, because these ar- eas are blasted wastelands without anything to protect. They are where the most forgotten parts of the world go to stay lost. That means things like ghouls and paracritters may be found. Types of Security Offered: None Typical Security Force: None</p>
<p class="calibre1">security rating E The main difference between Z and E zones is that some people tend to live in E zones, occasion- ally in actual apartment buildings. Conditions are poor and resources are scarce, so the powers that be can’t be brought to care much about these areas. Police patrols are still mostly nonexistent, but law enforcement will respond to calls made by people</p>
<p class="calibre1">RUNNING THE GAME // SECURITY, SENSORS, AND SCANNERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">with a SIN. Gang enforcement is the real force to reckon with here, though; many make their homes in E zones and don’t react well to outsiders. Types of Security Offered: Slow, half-hearted police response, more vigorous gang response. Lit- tle to no magic or Matrix support. Typical Security Force: Two beat cops (Profes- sional Rating 3) or five to six gangers (Professional Rating 1) plus 1 lieutenant.</p>
<p class="calibre1">security rating D These areas haven’t made it up to “nice” yet, but they contain enough corp drones that the overseers feel some obligation to provide police response. Patrols happen maybe twice a day, investigations are cursory, and the officers are inexperienced. The gangs are invested but cautious, knowing police response is more likely if they get too aggressive. Types of Security Offered: Police response with- in twenty minutes, cautious gang response. Little to no magic or Matrix support. Typical Security Force: Two beat cops (Profes- sional Rating 3) or four gangers (Professional Rat- ing 1) plus 1 lieutenant.</p>
<p class="calibre1">security rating C These areas are nice enough to the point where the corps have to consider reputational risk. They don’t keep anything truly valuable in these areas, of course, but if they let criminals run rampant over the people who live here, they’ll look ineffec- tual and weak, and that matters to them&mdash;more than the actual people matter to them, as it hap- pens. In most corps, housing facilities are more expensive to replace than low-level workers, so they take property damage especially seriously. Patrols happen every hour or two, gang activity is muted and far less violent than in D and E zones. Organized crime, on the other hand, often has strongholds in these areas, so caution needs to be paid if any group has an interest in a particular property. Types of Security Offered: Police response with- in fifteen minutes; spirits (Force 2&ndash;3) sent to in- vestigate reports of violent magic. Remote Matrix spiders (Professional Level 3) might investigate ex- tensive hacking efforts. Typical Security Force: Four beat cops and a lieutenant (Professional Rating 3) or three orga- nized crime gang members (Professional Rating 4)</p>
<p class="calibre1">security rating B This is where the corps start getting interested. Residential areas with this designation have people who, while not irreplaceable, are annoying to have to keep replacing. Industrial and commercial areas in this category are moneymakers&mdash;they don’t have top-secret prototypes or anything, but they either</p>
<p class="calibre1">do good business or make stuff that makes the corp money. Does the existence of a corp hinge on a B zone staying safe? No.&nbsp;That’s why it’s not rated any higher. But the corp would prefer that it stay safe, so some resources are committed to keeping it safe, typically including around-the-clock security. Crime-wise, these areas are beyond the reach of gangs and solidly in organized crime territory. Their truly high-end activities get a higher desig- nation, but things like a profitable bunraku parlor or gambling salon will get this level of protection. Types of Security Offered: On-site security at all times, with reinforcements within ten minutes, including magical support (two Force 4 spirits). Matrix spiders (Professional Rating 4) regularly check on Matrix infrastructure in the area. Typical Security Force: Four cops/security offi- cers and one lieutenant on site (Professional Rat- ing 3); four more officers (Professional Rating 3) and two SWAT officers (Professional Rating 5) in response teams. Five organized crime members and one lieutenant (Professional Rating 4) on site.</p>
<p class="calibre1">security rating A In the minds of corp executives, this is where the bulk of the world’s population lives, in well-kept neighborhoods with regular police patrols and rapid response. In reality, this is the first level for the elite of the world&mdash;between one-quarter and one-third of the world live in A zones or higher. Patrols of live officers are supplemented by occasional (about once a day) passes of spirits and drones. Organized crime is present, but it puts its best foot forward, looking corporate and keeping on- site violence to a minimum. That just means extra headaches for shadowrunners, because the security they use in these spots tends to be subtle and good at getting the job done while staying out of sight. Plenty of illicit narcotics are shipped out of A-rated zones, packaged to look as innocuous as possible. Types of Security Offered: Spirits (Force 4&ndash;5) and drones (Device Rating 4&ndash;5) provide occasion- al astral and Matrix overwatch, and some form of security patrol passes by every five minutes. Typical Security Force: Six cops/security officers and two lieutenants on site (Professional Rating 3); four SWAT officers and a lieutenant (Professional Rating 5) in response teams, and multiple response teams may be called. Six organized crime members and two lieutenants (Professional Rating 4) on site.</p>
<p class="calibre1">security rating AA Black marketeers dream of these neighbor- hoods. There are enough high-value electronics in a single residential block to keep a dealer in clover for months. The trick, of course, is getting your hands on the stuff, and the security is there to make that difficult. Spirits and drones come by</p>

<p class="calibre1">multiple times per day, mundane patrols are very regular, and emergency calls practically get an army appearing in response. Some organized crime bosses live in AA neigh- borhoods, but they’re usually considered fine, tax-paying residents, so they rely on the same law enforcement that everyone else uses, and they get the same response rates. Sometimes they’ll have something super-sensitive with AA security, like a drug-manufacturing lab. In those cases, they’ll provide the security themselves, as calling the cops to stop a robbery at a drug plant never works out well for anyone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some magic research facilities and Matrix data havens have AA security, too. As would be expect- ed, it leans more toward magic and Matrix securi- ty, respectively. Types of Security Offered: Two spirits (Force 5&ndash;6) and drones (Device Rating 5&ndash;6) provide oc- casional astral and Matrix overwatch, and some form of security patrol passes by every five min- utes. Magical barriers are used along with phys- ical barriers. Typical Security Force: Four elite corporate se- curity and a lieutenant on site (Professional Rating 7); six SWAT officers and two lieutenants (Profes- sional Rating 5) in response teams, and multiple response teams may be called. Eight organized crime members and four lieutenants (Professional Rating 4) on site.</p>
<p class="calibre1">security rating AAA At this point, things are very serious. Given that this is as high as the ratings go, you can expect all the stops to be pulled. Magic, Matrix, and physi- cal security will all get their due attention, and the operators will be well trained and not interested in any nonsense. The corps have all the money in the world, and they focus it on keeping these areas safe. Types of Security Offered: Astral and Matrix overwatch is continual. Spirits are Force 6 and up, drones Device Rating 6 and up, and world-class security spiders work hand-in-hand with GOD to keep the areas safe. Magical barriers are used along with physical barriers. Typical Security Force: Eight elite corporate security and two lieutenants on site (Profession- al Rating 7); four special forces officers and two lieutenants (Professional Rating 9&ndash;10) in response teams, and multiple response teams may be called.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Locked Doors and Other Mechanisms These are some of the ways people try to keep you out of the places you want to go.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Doors and Windows Doors start at Structure rating 5; nicer neighbor- hoods and offices have rating 7 to 9. Glass starts at 2, but it’s only that low in drek neighborhoods; when things get serious, it’s rating 9 to 11. All windows rat- ing 4 and higher have a reflective coating that can be switched on and off wirelessly, mainly to prevent ma- gicians from getting line of sight to anything inside.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Key Locks Seen only in the most low-tech, low-income neighborhoods, mechanical key locks are viewed as quaint by most people, and easy to shoot by</p>
<p class="calibre1">RUNNING THE GAME // SECURITY, SENSORS, AND SCANNERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">the others. Still, they might slow people down for a few seconds. They can be picked with a lockpick kit and an Engineering + Agility test with a thresh- old equal to the lock’s rating. An autopicker adds +1 to your dice pool. Slightly more complicated are transponder-em- bedded keys, which have a specifically calibrated re- sistor to complete a circuit on the lock. An electron- ics kit is needed to attempt to pick the lock. This is also an Engineering + Agility (lock rating) test. Maglocks are the most popular locking device in the Sixth World. They are frequently attached to a system that logs each opening and closing of the door. They can be designed to open with a wide variety of inputs&mdash;a key card, biometric data, a sequence of numbers, a proximity card, whatev- er. The procedures differ for the different types of lock, but they all start with the same first step&mdash;the case protecting the internal mechanism needs to be removed, which requires an Engineering + Agility (lock rating x 2, 1 combat round) Extended test. Alternately, it can be broken off; treat it as having a Structure rating equal to twice its lock rating. The next step depends on the type of access. For keypads, the internal circuitry needs to be re- wired with an Engineering + Agility (lock rating x 2, 1 combat round) Extended test. A sequencer can be used instead; this is a straight-up Opposed test between the rating of the sequencer and the rating of the maglock. This same process can be used for cardreaders, but there is another option&mdash;using a maglock passkey (p.&nbsp;278) with an Opposed test between the passkey rating vs.&nbsp;the maglock rating. Biometric scanners come in many forms, including print scanners, voice recognition systems, breath scanners, cellular scanners, DNA scanners, and facial recognition scanners. The prime way of de- feating these is to get a copy or sample of the thing being scanned&mdash;a cellular glove molder (p.&nbsp;278) for fingerprints, retinal duplication (p.&nbsp;285) for eye scans, or a voice modulator (p.&nbsp;285) for voice recog- nition. Breath, cellular, and DNA scanners are a lit- tle more complicated. First you need to get the right sample, then you need to preserve it in a chemical bath, which can be made in a chemical shop with a Biotech + Logic (5, 1 hour) Extended test. For a face scanner, you need a face, and a picture won’t cut it. Don’t think you can get cute by just cutting some- one’s face off, either, because that messes up the bone and muscle structure. A makeup or disguise kit can be used, making an Opposed test of Con + Charisma vs.&nbsp;the device rating of the scanner. Magic can also be used as long as it has a physical compo- nent; the net hits on the Spellcasting test would be the threshold for the device rating to beat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sensors and Scanners Alarms, a form of passive security, are one of the most basic elements of a security system.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alarms serve to alert guards, security hackers/ riggers, or remote monitoring services that some- thing is amiss and must be dealt with. Alarms may be silent, alerting only the security or police in order to catch intruders unaware, or they may go off as flashing lights and loud warning klaxons that resound throughout the building. Individual components of a security system may be alarmed, like a fire door that triggers a warning bell when opened. Many alarms, particularly on doors and windows, are based on electrical circuits that sound when the item is opened or broken. To by- pass such alarms, the circuit’s electrical contacts must be fooled while the door/window is open. This requires an Engineering + Agility (5, 1 min- ute) Extended test, though particular designs may increase the challenge. A wire is one of the most basic types of secu- rity scanners. Breaking wire is often tied to some sort of alarm system to notify security personnel but can also trigger other kinds of automated se- curity systems. In some rare cases, the wire may be intended to harm the target. Stringing monow- ire across a potential intrusion point is a common choice for this purpose. If a character fails a Per- ception test, they will run into the wire and trig- ger its effect. This could be activating the alarm system or taking damage. Barbed wires intended to harm do 2P damage, electric wires do 3S, and monowire does 4P. Trip beams are used as perimeter alarms or across entrances. Trip beams consist of laser emit- ters (visible or infrared), mirrors, and laser detec- tors. If the beam of light is interrupted by some- thing passing through it, the alarm goes off. These systems can be very complex, requiring anywhere from several to twenty or more mirrors and reflec- tors to aim the light beam where desired. Noticing a trip beam requires a Perception + Intuition (2) test for visible beams, or a threshold of 3 for in- frared beams. Laser beams are more noticeable in smoke or if an aerosol spray is used, reducing the threshold to 1. Squeezing past a trip beam maze requires an Athletics + Agility test against a game- master-determined threshold. Trip beams may also be fooled by simultaneously lining up proxy laser emitters of the proper wattage into each detector on the system, requiring a similar Athletics + Agil- ity test. A calibrated system of mirrors may also be used to re-arrange the trip beam pattern so that someone can pass through. Figuring out the right pattern requires an Engineering + Logic (3) test, while placing each mirror is Athletics + Agility (3). Pressure pads complement any indoor security in areas that are restricted or off-limits to unau- thorized personnel (particularly at night, when no one should be about). These are weight-triggered sensors that react to any amount of weight, or when there is too much weight beyond a pre-pro- grammed amount (where the maximum allow-</p>
<p class="calibre1">241</p>
<p class="calibre1">SECURITY, SENSORS, AND SCANNERS // RUNNING THE GAME</p>
<p class="calibre1">242</p>
<p class="calibre1">able weight is two to four kilos heavier than the heaviest authorized individual). A pressure mesh works similarly but is largely for outdoor use and installed in the ground. It’s also less sensitive than pads. Noticing pressure mesh or pads is very dif- ficult, requiring a Perception test with a threshold of 3 for pads and 4 for mesh. If a character steps on a pad, however, it is more apparent (reduce the threshold by 2)&mdash;but by then it is usually too late. If successful, the character can attempt to remove the pressure before it exceeds the device’s weight allowance. This is very difficult, requiring a Reac- tion + Intuition (3) test, with the character’s Body serving as a negative dice pool modifier. Motion sensors, well, sense movement. They transmit an ultrasonic field and react to changes in that field when anything enters it. Intruders may detect the ultrasonic field by using an ultrasound sensor set to passive mode within five meters. De- feating a motion sensor requires that characters move very slowly through the field, one half-meter per combat round, and succeeding in a Stealth + Agility (3) test. Twitchy, wired-up characters will find this very uncomfortable; apply a negative dice pool modifier equal to their extra Initiative Dice (that is, any dice beyond the first one). Capacitance wire, or proximity wire, detects the electrical charge of a metahuman body (or an- imal) within two meters. It is often used around a building’s perimeter fencing, on secure entrance- ways, or on special objects, and it either triggers a regular alarm or switches on security cameras and other measures. For redundancy, it might be used in conjunction with motion sensors. Sound detectors and vibration detectors uti- lize sensitive microphones to pick up sounds/vi- brations. They can be programmed with pattern recognition algorithms to ignore some sounds/ vibrations, but will easily pick up everything else not fitting within those parameters. Characters attempting to sneak by a known sound detector must succeed at a Stealth + Agility (3) test (Silence spells can also be used). Some sound detectors may be programmed to trigger an alert only when cer- tain sounds are detected, such as gunshots (per- haps even triangulating the sound’s origin with multiple detectors). Security cameras fill a broad spectrum, from the standard visual type to low-light, infrared, and ultraviolet cameras or sensors. Cameras help se- curity personnel maintain a secondary eye on ev- ery significant area of traffic when guards are pa- trolling, and they maintain watch when personnel are not in physical or astral proximity. Infrared, also known as thermographic, picks up on body heat signatures (but may be fooled by an Improved Invisibility spell). One security trick is to use sur- faces that are reflective on the infrared spectrum on corner areas, so that thermographic cameras can detect intruders from around corners where</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cameras themselves cannot be easily seen. Low- light sensors amplify the ambient light in order to produce an image in darkened spots (making the camera harder to spot) but may be overpowered with bright light. Shadowrunners may take advan- tage of this with stun grenades (p.&nbsp;263). How well any of these cameras or sensors may be spotted will depend partially on how well they are hidden. Typical cameras on fixed or pivoting mounts can be easily seen if characters are looking for them. Smaller micro-cameras have a threshold of 3 to be spotted with a Perception test. If the camera is hid- den, increase the threshold to spot it. Olfactory scanners, also known as chemical de- tection systems or chemsniffers, analyze molecules in the air for nitrogen-rich particles like those giv- en off by explosives or firearm ammunition. These are popular in places where firearms are forbidden and security personnel are limited to tasers and stun batons. To detect explosives or ammunition, roll a dice pool equal to the chemsniffer’s rating against a threshold 2 (3 if the explosives/ammo are hermetically sealed). Apply modifiers as noted on the Chemical Detection Modifiers table.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chemical Detection Modifiers table</p>
<p class="calibre1">Every 10 rounds of ammo +1 Every grenade +1 Every 30 grams of non-plastique explosive +1 Every 100 grams of plastique +1 Item contained in plastic 1 Olfactory scanners can also be used as pher- omone scanners to detect the pheromones that metahuman bodies release into the air. These are uncommon but can be useful for detecting individuals who have otherwise effectively con- cealed themselves via technological or magical means from regular security devices. Pheromone scanners are sophisticated enough to tell the dif- ference between a metahuman and an animal, and even different metatypes and species. They are not, however, advanced enough to single out an individual. In order to pick up a scent, the scanner rolls its device rating against a threshold of 3 (2 for characters with tailored pheromone bioware). Magnetic anomaly detectors (MADs) detect metallic substances for the purpose of finding con- cealed weaponry. Naturally, MADs do not work against non-metallic substances like wood, stone, or plastic. To determine if the detector finds a weapon, make a test using the device’s rating as the dice pool; a single hit detects any ferrous-metal weapons or objects (guns, knives, etc.).</p>

<p class="calibre1">Millimeter wave detection systems, also known as cyberware scanners, process video taken in the millimeter wave spectrum to identify the energy signatures of cyberware and concealed items (spe- cifically weapons) on a person. These devices can perceive through thick layers of clothing and oth- er concealment to identify items from a distance of fifteen meters away. To determine if the detec- tor scans cyberware or a prohibited item, roll the device rating and compare the hits scored to the thresholds given on the Cyberware Scanner Table. Millimeter wave scans can detect any non-biolog- ical item by its shape and composition, assuming the item is listed in the device’s database. If the threshold is reached, the scanner detects the item/ implant and notes its general locations and type; additional hits provide more detail (function, mod- el, grade, etc.).</p>

<p class="calibre1">Run Compensation You know how runners are&mdash;once they finish a job, they want to get paid. As if they were actual employees or something. So demanding. Anyway, that’s their expectation, so you, as the stand-in for Mr.&nbsp;Johnson, will have to deliver the compensa- tion the runners want. The question is, how much should it be? Run compensation comes in two basic forms (setting aside changes to Heat, Reputation, and contacts, all of which were discussed previously in this chapter): Karma and cash. We’ll discuss each one in turn.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Karma Karma awards should be given at the end of each gaming session. The question is, how big should those awards be? The essential number of Karma to remember is 5. That’s the multiplier per rank of attributes and skills, it’s how much specializations and expertise cost, and it’s the cost of new spells and complex forms. What that means is each time a character earns 5 Karma, they have a chance to get an im- provement for their character, or make a significant step to the next skill or attribute rank. So at the end of each gaming session, the gamemaster can ask themselves a simple question: How close to a good increase should the characters get after this session? Did they struggle to make progress? Then a 1- or 2-Karma award might be appropriate for that session. Some more significant gains might get 3 or 4 Karma, and if they really did an excellent job or finished up a run, 5 or even 6 might be appro- priate. The gamemaster can give more than that at their discretion, but it should be rare.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cash Generally speaking, it’s easier to make payments on a per-runner basis. Runners can redistribute it if they want among them, but having Mr.&nbsp;Johnson make an offer for a payment for each runner makes it clear from the outset what the job will pay. Just as 5 Karma is used as a basic unit for mea- suring how much the Karma award should be, cash rewards can be based on 5,000 nuyen&mdash;the cost of one month of a Middle lifestyle. Was the job a sim- ple night’s work that was easily handled? That’s probably not worth a full month’s pay. Was it a long, grueling job with lots of danger? Maybe they deserve two or three months of a decent lifestyle. Is it a huge score with the kind of danger few are willing to risk, and the kind of moral compromise few are willing to make? That might be six figures, making it a couple of years of the Middle lifestyle. This does not, of course, mean the runners will spend the money they earn on supporting their lifestyle and not work for a month or two. There are vehicles and drones and cyberware and cyber- decks and foci and DocWagon contracts to buy. And, of course, guns and ammo. Whatever they ac- tually do with the money, though, the 5,000-nuyen figure provides a good base.</p>

<p class="calibre1">RUN COMPENSATION // RUNNING THE GAME</p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re only as good as your gear. It’s a common saying, but it’s true, especially on the mean streets of the Sixth World. Having the wrong gear at the right time or the right gear at the wrong time are both potentially fatal flaws. Either way you’re probably going to end up in a world of hurt, or worse.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gear Stats The key functions of any piece of gear in Shad- owrun are expressed in its game stats. The exact categories of stats depend on the item’s type. Cost is a universal stat&mdash;everything costs money&mdash;and all items also have Availability. We’ll cover that and some of the more specialized stats.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Availability Availability expresses how easy it is to find a piece of gear. The higher the number, the more</p>
<p class="calibre1">scarce the item is. Availabilities typically range from 1 to 6, but circumstances can push them up to 9. Note that the top levels of Availability are pri- marily reserved for alphaware, betaware, and del- taware versions of augmentations. Availability ratings give a general sense to the gamemaster of whether player charac- ters can find a given item, but they also can be used in mechanics in two ways. First, the Availability rating can be used as a threshold in Matrix Search tests to find someone who car- ries the item&mdash;though the gamemaster should note that just because the players find a seller doesn’t mean that seller will be easily accessi- ble. Second, players may ask a contact to locate an item. Generally speaking, contacts can find goods whose Availability is less than (not equal to) their Connection rating. Whether they con- nect the player characters to the gear is a ques- tion of Loyalty and role-playing.</p>

<p class="calibre1">245</p>
<p class="calibre1">3 These are starting to be boutique items, the type of things aficionados seek out, or things that are made in relatively small batches. They’re not the rarest items, but they’re also not sitting in a ton of stores across the sprawl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">5 True specialty items. These may be collector’s items or things deliberately made for a niche audience, but they are not at all easy to find.</p>
<p class="calibre1">7 These items are not available off-the-rack. They are specially ordered and custom-made.</p>
<p class="calibre1">9 The most rare items money can buy&mdash;you just have to find the person who will take your cash. Owning one of these marks you as a member of the elite, and selling one of them brings in extra cash due to their scarcity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Legality Some items are listed with an (I) or (L) as part of their Availability rating. The former refers to items that are illegal for private ownership in most plac- es, which means they are only allowed in the pos- session of security, megacorporate, or government entities. The latter designation is attached to items that require a license (p.&nbsp;273) in order to legally possess or transport them. Licenses are bought and attached to SINs (or fake SINs). The legal status of any given item is dependent on the local laws. What’s legal in the UCAS may not be legal in CalFree, or vice versa. The listings here are for the UCAS and Seattle in particular, as the UCAS has several laws (like gun possession) that vary by state.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Active Program Slots This shows how many programs an electronic device can have running at a single time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ammo This is the ammo capacity a firearm has, as well as the type of container&mdash;(belt) belt, (c) clip, (cy) cylinder, (m) magazine, (ml) missile, or (z) muzzle loaders.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Attack Ratings This is the Attack Ratings the weapon uses. The rating is an abstraction of different characteristics of the weapon that make it more efficient and ef- fective on the attack. This is listed as five numbers, representing, in order, the ratings for Close, Near, Medium, Far, and Extreme ranges.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Attributes For Matrix items, this lists the attribute ar- ray an item has for the categories of Attack (A), Sleaze (S), Data Processing (D), and Firewall (F). The first two and the last two are typically paired together.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blast This is the size of a blast of an explosive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Capacity Some items can hold modifications and other adaptations, and they have a Capacity rating to in- dicate how much they can hold. Other items take up this space&mdash;those items have a Capacity rating listed in brackets [].</p>
<p class="calibre1">Damage Value (DV) This is used for weapons and is the base dam- age the weapon inflicts if it hits. It may have a let- ter indicating its elemental damage, such as (e) for electricity or (f) for fire. For explosives, this is list- ed at different ranges, including ground zero (GZ), Close, and Near ranges.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Defense Rating This is the boost to a character’s Defense Rating that an item provides.</p>
<p class="calibre1">// GEAR</p>

<p class="calibre1">Device Rating Used for electronic devices, this is a kind of all-purpose stat that reflects the devices overall power and systems integrity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Essence Used for cyberware and bioware, this shows the Essence reduction you experience when installing this item.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Modes These are the firing modes firearms use, as dis- cussed on p.&nbsp;108.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mount This describes where an accessory is placed, as per the rules on p.&nbsp;259.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rating If an item has a range of ratings in which it is available, it is listed in this column or next to the item’s name.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vehicle Stats Vehicles have a bunch of stats&mdash;they’re de- scribed on p.&nbsp;198.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moving Gear Standard Goods Some general assumptions of item ownership come with the purchase of a Lifestyle (see p.&nbsp;56). Basic clothing and doss furnishings would be in- cluded along with general amenities appropriate to the Lifestyle level. These items only need to be worried about when a character loses their Life- style or doss due to unforeseen circumstances, but they are replaced as soon as the runner buys a new Lifestyle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Starting Gear Runners use the funds they get at character creation to buy their initial gear. This includes arms, armor, tech, vehicles, and everything else that wouldn’t be a normal part of everyday life. These items should have some kind of note on where they are stored, because the runner could lose items if they keep them in their vehicle and it gets stolen, keep them at their doss and it gets burned, or keep them on their person and they get pinched.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fencing Gear Let’s make this simple. In order to fence the valuables you come across, you need a contact who’s in the right field (your bartender contact isn’t going to be the most useful helping you un- load that cyberdeck prototype you lifted from Mitsuhama). If you have the right contact, you can get back ten percent of the base value on the item, plus one percent for every hit on an Influence + Charisma test. If the item is particularly hot or desired (according to the gamemaster’s discretion) the whole selling process could be more adventur- ous and offer a bigger payday, but that’s up to the individual running the show.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Concealing Gear Sometimes you want to keep your stuff away from prying eyes. There is no active test for hiding gear&mdash;you put it in its carrier or holster or what- ever and hope the equipment does its job. Spotting gear is based on a Concealability threshold that is used in Perception tests. Items have a base thresh- old based on their general size and shape; some items change this based on their design, whether they are built to be hidden or bulkier than normal and hard to make disappear. All these thresholds assume the item is being hidden by the owner&mdash;if you’re holding the item openly in your hand, the Concealability threshold would not apply.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Size Cost Adjustments Most gear is built to be used by humans, or at least human-sized creatures. Elves and orks are close enough to human sizes that they can generally make this gear work for them, but it’s not as easy for dwarfs and trolls. They usually need to shop at spe- cial stores or order their gear with certain customi- zations made to it. To account for this, dwarfs pay a ten percent markup on all the fitted gear they pur- chase. This applies to items like armor and clothes,</p>

<p class="calibre1">but not stuff like weapons and commlinks. When in doubt, the gamemaster makes the call of when to apply it. It’s harder for trolls, and they experience a ten percent markup on everything. Even AR setting have to be adjusted to fit trolls’ thick fingers, and every piece of gear needs some kind of adjustment for their size, strength, and dermal deposits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Using Unadapted Gear Sometimes a dwarf or a troll has to use some- one else’s stuff or make do with what’s handy. Any time a dwarf or troll uses gear that is not adapt- ed for them, they suffer a &ndash;2 dice pool penalty on all actions involving that gear. This means armor doesn’t close right, guns don’t fit right, commlinks aren’t easy to use, etc.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wireless Functionality Nearly every device is wireless. The wireless revolution started for tracking purposes, though most of the tracking was about observing consum- er behavior. The corps also found it useful for in- ventory tracking and seeing how people used their goods. The only trick was finding a way to make sure consumers had a reason to keep the wireless functionality on at all times. That led to … the wireless bonus!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wireless Bonus Many items have a bonus applied when they’re kept attached to the Matrix. For the bulk of the population, this is just a little convenient aid in their normal life, but for runners it is often a do- or-die decision, because leaving your Smartgun XI linked to the Matrix could be the little edge you need, or it could be your doom as you get hacked and the fancy electronics-laden SMG becomes a paperweight. Items with a bonus are listed, and some have it listed for the entire category as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning It Off Separating yourself and your gear from the Ma- trix is easy. An Electronics + Logic (1) Test as a Minor Action is all it takes in combat. The rest of the time, you can just assume you can figure it out as long as you have the Electronics skill.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Throwbacks These devices are older tech. Whether it’s be- cause they’re incompatible with the current Ma- trix or devoid of a way to interface with it, they don’t have a way to connect and gain any bonus from the wireless world. They also can’t be hacked in any way shape or form other than the other use of the word, like when a troll swings his axe and hacks your antique rifle in half.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gear Listing Melee Welcome to the land of the Close Combat skill. The weapons here range from the classic, simple and primitive, to the elegant futuretech designs of the minds at Evo, but they all supply the hurt with the help of some good old-fashioned metahumanpower.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blades Sharp edges provide the lethal advantage to ev- erything with a blade. Brute force works, but ele- gant style is just as effective with objects honed to a razor sharpness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Combat axe Whether you’re Neal the Firefighter or Neil the Ork Barbarian, you can swing an axe for both util- ity and violence. The combat axe come with a sin- gle or double blade and a hardened spring-loaded thrusting point for breaking glass or providing an unpleasant surprise. In the overmuscled hands of a 2080s street warrior, this weapon can be far dead- lier than a firearm.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Combat Knife A simple, elegant, efficient killing device with a chisel point to make light work of armor. It’s also carbon-coated black, so no reflections give away your approach.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Forearm snap blades Don’t like getting implants but still want three ra- zor sharp blades to pop out of your forearm? This is the weapon for you. The blades extend and retract through either a forearm muscle command or a wire- less signal. Either way, it takes a Minor Action. Wireless bonus: The blades grant an extra Minor Action on the turn when they are extended or retracted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Katana The iconic two-handed sword of the samurai is standard issue for trid-series shadowrunners. Out on the street, the deadly blade teaches lessons to those who think the trope is solely about looks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Knife A catchall term for a variety of different deadly fighting blades. The style is up to you, but the stats are all the same.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Polearm Take a long stick, add any of a dozen varieties of blades to the head, and you’ve got a polearm.</p>
<p class="calibre1">247</p>
<p class="calibre1">// GEAR</p>
<p class="calibre1">248</p>
<p class="calibre1">Designed to keep distance between attacker and defender or strike at a mounted target, they’re not common street weapons. They’re nearly impossi- ble to conceal, even for a troll, but they’re great at keeping problems at a safe distance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Survival knife Specifically designed with a cutting edge on one side and a serrated sawing edge on the other, the true “survival” piece of this knife is in the han- dle and its collection of accessories. In the handle you’ll find a GPS monitor, mini-multitool, and mi- cro-lighter. The blade is coated with a photovoltaic skin that blacks out the blade to prevent unwanted reflection; when charged, the skin can be activated to provide two hours of light. Combat stats are the same as the combat knife. Wireless bonus: The knife displays an ARO of local maps and your GPS position, along with pro- viding basic biomonitor data when in your hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sword A heavy blade on a one-handed grip that comes in a variety of styles. The world’s dominant com- bat weapon for thousands of years until the fire- arm came along.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clubs Club The stats listed can be used for a range of ob- jects, including an axe handle, baseball bat, crow- bar, tire iron, wrench, or even a two-by-four with a couple nails in it. The price listed is for a profes- sionally made, old-style police baton, but it would be relatively easy to find one for free in a pinch.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Extendable baton This telescoping club can be extended with a wrist flick or a wireless signal. In its retracted form, it’s easier to conceal (Concealability threshold 4 when retracted, 2 when extended). Retracting or extending it is a Minor Action. Wireless bonus: You gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when you retract or extend the baton.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sap Also known as a blackjack, this is a short, flex- ible club or a leather-wrapped iron, lead, or sand filled sack for thumping heads. It’s designed to be concealable, often fitting in the palm of the hand (Concealability threshold 4).</p>

Also, the whip’s built-in safety system retracts automatically instead of hit- ting you on a critical glitch.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shock Gloves Insulated gloves with an integrated system that discharges electric current with any contact after they’ve been activated. The gloves inflict the Zapped status (p.&nbsp;53) and are good for ten charges before they need to be plugged in and recharged (at a rate of one charge per ten seconds). The charge is activated with a muscle command or via wireless signal, which takes a Minor Action. Wireless bonus: You gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when you activate a charge. The shock gloves recharge by induction, regaining one charge per half hour of wireless-enabled time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thrown/Projectile Attacks using weapons in this category are made using the Athletics skill.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bow Everything from the traditional longbow of fi- berglass or wood to the modern compound bow. These archaic weapons aren’t common on the streets of 2080. They have the advantage of be- ing hacker-proof as long as you leave off the fancy add-ons. Nocking an arrow takes a Minor Action (Ready Weapon, p.&nbsp;43). Bows have a rating that in- dicates the minimum Strength you need to use the weapon. The weapon’s rating is also used to deter- mine damage (maximum rating is 14). Arrows also have ratings, and they must equal or exceed that of the bow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crossbow Modern crossbows are designed with autoload- ing systems, internal magazines that hold up to four bolts, and come in light, medium, and heavy designs. Light models are single-handed, while me- dium and heavy designs require two hands.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Injection Arrow/Bolt The injection arrow or bolt causes its base dam- age while also delivering a payload of one dose of a drug or toxin. A successful hit must deal at least</p>
<p class="calibre1">GEAR //</p>
<p class="calibre1">one box of damage after the Damage Resistance test. Injection arrows and bolts come at a base rating of 8. Higher-rating models are available for heavier bows, but lower-rating models aren’t stur- dy enough to deliver this heavier projectile. Wireless bonus: The injection can be delayed until a wireless signal is sent. The injection also doesn’t need a box of damage; it just needs at least 1 net hit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Throwing Knives/Shuriken From stars to spikes and everything in between, these stats cover all the muscle-powered, small throwing weapons on the market. Up to (Agility/2) of these weapons can be readied for throwing with a Ready Weapon action. Wireless bonus: Successful hits leave wireless weapons in targets that can be used to predict movement patterns and offer an estimated lo- cation. A successful hit offers anyone wirelessly linked to the throwing weapon and using a smar- tlink system a +1 dice pool bonus for their attacks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Firearms Leadslingers abound on the streets of 2080 (the name remains, even though lead rounds aren’t the norm anymore). For years, the streets managed to snag and use caseless rounds in order to stay clear of the law tracking them, but recent events have led arms manufacturers (a.k.a. the megacorps) to desire a tighter leash on their shadow assets, and cased ammo is becoming the norm once again, with each casing containing a microRFID to identify the weapon and location where it was fired. The glo- ry of watching spent shells spinning through the air is back, and so are the back-alley reloads and scrubbed slugs to keep those of us in the shadows off the radar. Weapons are chambered for cased or caseless, with caseless ammo being marginally harder to track but tougher to find on the streets. Wireless bonus: All modern firearms are con- sidered to be wireless-equipped and come with a digital ammunition counter and an ARO that tells you the ammo type loaded. If equipped with DNI, you gain a bonus Minor Action any turn when you eject a clip (for weapons that have them) or change fire modes (on models that have more than one).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tasers Tasers accept top-mounted accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Defiance Super Shock This heavy-duty taser can fire up to four darts with twenty-meter-long wires. The wired connec- tion to the battery allows for a more powerful shock but limits range. It can also be used point-</p>
<p class="calibre1">blank in Close Combat for the same damage. Af- ter a successful hit, if the target does not knock the lines free, the attacker may use a Major Action to inflict the base damage of the weapon again by opening another set of capacitors. Wireless bonus: A successful hit informs you of the status of the target’s basic health in terms of Condition Monitors (general statements, rather than exact number of boxes left).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yamaha Pulsar I/II The Pulsar uses wireless capacitors, meaning that the Pulsar has increased range compared to other wired tasers. As a trade-off, it packs a lit- tle less punch than wired models, but it fires fast- er and delivers repeated hits. The Pulsar I has no melee contacts, but the Pulsar II includes a pair of contacts on the base of the grip to use in melee (treat these as a Close Combat attack as a Club). Wireless bonus: A successful hit informs you of the status of the target’s basic health and Condi- tion Monitors (general statements, rather than ex- act number of boxes left).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hold-outs Hold-outs can’t take accessories or modifications.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fichetti Tiffani Needler Pretty and deadly are not mutually exclusive. Fichetti gunsmithing combined with Tiffani style makes the Needler the single most popular design- er handgun in the world. The base model is matte grey, but its special color-changing coating can be manipulated via wireless signal with an infinite number of patterns and designs. The coating al- lows your gun to match your shoes, your handbag, or the camo pattern of your fatigues. The Needler only chambers caseless flechette rounds, which are already factored into its damage code. Wireless bonus: You can change the color of the Fichetti Tiffani Needler with a Minor Action. Applying a camouflage pattern to the Needler in- creases the concealability threshold by 1 for visual Perception tests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Streetline Special Designed for cheap 3D nanoprinting, the Street- line Special is made of composite materials, making it harder to detect with MAD scanners (increasing the threshold to detect it by 1).</p>

<p class="calibre1">Light pistols can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ares Light Fire Series The Light Fire Series is designed for special op- erators. The 70 is a street standard, while the 75 is not commonly available through regular dealers and standard legal channels. But what runner uses those? The integration of a barrel-mounted silenc- er in both designs makes the Light Fire series near- ly trid-flick silent. The 75 comes preloaded with smartlink hard- ware and software, and both come with a laser sight. The silencer for these models increases the threshold for audio Perception tests by 3 for the Light Fire Series when equipped and costs 750¥.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beretta T-series The preferred sidearm of many security forces around the world, the T-series is classified as a light pistol, even though the 201 design offers automat- ic fire capability, making it popular in nations that limit heavy and machine pistols. Since the frame is the same, it’s easier to disguise as a 101. The 201 also comes with a detachable shoulder stock, though it is often lost before the gun reaches the street market.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Colt America L36 A tribute to Colt’s world-class reputation, the L36 is cheap, easily concealed, and abundant on the streets. In order to be easily transferred be- tween corporate security rookies, the weapon fea-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tures an ownership swap feature that has been abused by cops and crooks alike. A perfect throw- away weapon. Wireless Bonus: The user can alter ownership data with a Minor Action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fichetti Security 600 Designed as a light sidearm for security forces, the thirty-round magazine allows them to miss a ton and not worry about running out of ammo. This also makes it great for deckers. The Security 600 comes with a detachable folding stock and laser sight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ruger Redhawk This rugged revolver is the kid brother of the legendary Super Warhawk. Designed with pre- cision and fun shooting in mind, the Redhawk has a revolutionary single/double firing selector. Classic double action allows a shot with each trigger pull (Semi-Auto Fire), while the single setting lets you play old-west gunslinger and “fan” the hammer (Burst Fire). Wireless Bonus: You get an extra Minor Action in a turn where you change the action selection.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Machine Pistols Machine pistols can take top- and barrel-mount- ed accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ares Crusader II High capacity and comfortable styling make the Ares Crusader II a standout in its class. The Ares brand is synonymous with functionality, and the Crusader II integrates a gas-vent recoil com- pensation system and comes standard with smart- gun systems and software preloaded.</p>

Built on the framing of the original Predator, the VI comes with the standard smartgun operations but adds Burst Fire capabil- ity and a new variable ammunition system that will make it king of the streets and warzones once again, even if it comes with a price tag to match that innovation. The variable ammunition system allows a single specially designed magazine (30¥ per spare) to be loaded with different ammo types. The smartgun is used to select ammo types and cycles them to the chamber in whatever quantity is necessary and available. If there aren’t enough rounds of a particular kind, the ammo counter reads empty and the weapon stops firing.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Barret Model 122 Sometimes you need to shoot an enemy; some- times you need to shoot an enemy through the side</p>
<p class="calibre1">of an APC. The Barret Model 122 excels at tearing through metal and getting to the things it attempts to protect, ripping apart machines and vehicles with horrible tearing sounds that are music to the ears of the shooter. It has a sound suppressor, smartgun system, and folding bipod.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Machine Guns Machine guns come in three categories&mdash;light, me- dium, and heavy&mdash;that determine their Attack Ratings. All, even the “light” ones, are bulky and unwieldy. A light machine gun is bigger and heavier than most ri- fles, while medium machine guns and heavy machine guns can only be carried by someone with Strength of 3+ and 5+, respectively, since they are designed as ve- hicle-mounted weapons. Machine guns can take top, barrel, and underbarrel accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ingram Valiant The Valiant light machine gun sits in the hands of mercenary units the world over. Basic equip- ment includes a rigid stock with shock pad, a laser sight, and a barrel-mounted gas-vent system.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stoner-Ares M202 This medium machine gun packs a tremendous punch and is often found in the hands of trolls with no concept of subtlety. It’s a brutally simple weapon, but accessorizing is always an option for those with a taste for more complexity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">RPK HMG This heavy machine gun is used by militaries across eastern Europe and Asia. Usually set up as a vehicle-mounted weapon, it comes standard with a detachable tripod, as the RPK is best fired from a prone, sitting, or kneeling position when not mounted on a vehicle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Panther XXL Bulky, ugly, deadly, and as destructive as they come. Panther’s XXL model of assault cannon is the thing of nightmares on the street. To make sure every shot counts, it comes with a built-in smartgun system.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Ares S-III Super Squirt That name is terrible. Everyone thinks the Super Squirt is some kind of water gun, but it’s basically a glorified paintball marker that fires nonlethal dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) gel packs. The DMSO forces the skin to absorb whichever chemicals the operator wishes to deliver. The at- tack itself causes no damage, but when the target is hit successfully, the DMSO delivers the sub- stance directly into the target’s bloodstream as a Contact-vector toxin (see Toxins and Drugs, p.&nbsp;121). The Super Squirt can accept top- and under- barrel-mounted accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parashield DART Series Bringing down trolls with a little plastic, steel, and chemical cocktail for decades, Parashield sets the industry standard for dart weapons. The pistol model can accept top-mounted accessories only. The rifle includes a top-mounted imaging scope and can mount top and underbarrel accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wireless bonus: The dart reports whether or not it has struck home and successfully injected along with the effect based on heart rate and pulse levels, although its medical sensors are not very sophisti- cated (Device Rating of 1 for the dart).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Launchers The Exotic Weapons skill is used to fire launch- ers, and they can take top and underbarrel acces- sories. Grenade launchers fire minigrenades, and missile launchers launch missiles or rockets.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ares Antioch II The Antioch II is the fanciest tube with a trigger around, complete with an integral smartgun sys- tem. A secondary trigger setting allows for wireless activation of launched projectiles. Wireless bonus: You can use the wireless link trigger for your grenades, even if you don’t have DNI.</p>

<p class="calibre1">259</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wireless bonus: When active the launcher will not detonate any ordnance loaded into the weapon within five meters of the weapon, even if a spoofed command tells it to do otherwise.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aztechnology Striker Deadly and disposable, the Striker is a great analogy for runners. The launch tube can be re- used, which is nice considering recent price in- creases. Wireless bonus: Connecting this launcher to the local Matrix provides a +1 dice pool bonus as long as no other bonus-applying systems are in use.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Onotari Interceptor Saeder-Krupp developed this multipurpose missile launcher for military use. It has two sep- arate barrels that can load two missiles at once, which don’t need to be the same type. Both barrels cannot be fired simultaneously, though this safety feature has been known to be removed, much to the dismay of the target&mdash;and the firer, as it turns out. It features an internal smartgun system that controls the fire-safety system. Firing both barrels launches both weapons. Split the attack dice pool and resolve each projectile independently. The firer must resist 6P Fire damage when launching both tubes. Wireless bonus: The safety system cannot be disengaged, but the firer gains the smartlink wire- less bonus.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Accessories Most firearm accessories must be attached to a particular mount&mdash;top, barrel, underbarrel. Each mount can only hold one accessory at a time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Airburst link A smartgun accessory for grenade and rocket launchers uses a rangefinder to air-burst the ex- plosive projectile in close proximity to the target. An airburst link reduces the scatter distance for a launched weapon by two meters per net hit instead of one meter per hit (Blast Attacks and Scatter, p. 114) when you use the wireless link trigger. The airburst link also prevents the defender from</p>
<p class="calibre1">using the Hit the Deck Action to reduce damage, as the Prone status offers no benefit against the air- burst. Wireless bonus: An airburst link requires wire- less functionality to function at all. Both the gre- nades and the launcher must have wireless mode turned on for the system to function.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bipod A two-legged brace extends down from the weapon, allowing it to be fired low to the ground with the user in a prone or sitting position. A bi- pod can be attached to the underbarrel mount of a weapon and provides a +2 to the Attack Rating when properly deployed. Attaching a bipod takes a Major Action. Folding up or deploying a bipod is a Minor Action. Wireless bonus: The Attack Rating bonus in- creases to +3 if used when prone or sitting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Concealable holster A small holster worn just about anywhere on the body it can’t be seen, attached with a smart adhesive. It increases the Concealability thresh- old of the weapon inside by 1. Only pistols (in- cluding machine pistols) and tasers fit in a con- cealable holster. Wireless bonus: Sensors, smart-fabric, and ac- tive adhesive allow the holster to alter color and move small amounts in real time, increasing the Concealability threshold by an additional 1.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gas-vent system Gas-vent recoil compensation systems are barrel-mounted accessories that vent a weapon’s barrel gases at a specific vector to counter muz- zle climb. Once installed, a gas-vent cannot be re- moved. Gas-vent systems remove the Attack Rat- ing penalty for Semi-Automatic fire and reduce it to 2 for Burst Fire.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gyro mount This heavy harness features an articulated and motorized gyro-stabilized arm. The mount can hold a rifle or machine gun. The system negates the Attack Rating adjustment for Semi-Auto and</p>
<p class="calibre1">// GEAR</p>
<p class="calibre1">260</p>
<p class="calibre1">Burst Fire and provides a +3 Attack Rating for Full-Auto. This system also shifts the Strength re- quirements for medium and heavy machine guns to 2+ and 4+ respectively. Attaching or removing a weapon from the mount takes a Minor Action. Putting on a gyro-mount harness takes about a minute, while the quick-release allows you to get out of it with a Major Action. Wireless bonus: Activating the harness’s quick-release with a wireless signal to exit the har- ness is a Minor Action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hidden arm slide Attached to the forearm and worn under cloth- ing, this slide can fit a Hold-out, Light Pistol, or Taser. With a Minor Action and a specific move- ment, the slide moves the weapon into your hand. The use of a hidden arm slide provides a bonus Edge when first used. It also increases the Conceal- ability threshold by 1. Wireless bonus: You get a bonus Minor Action on any turn when you activate the slide.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Imaging scope The classic top-mounted scope that includes a micro camera and vision magnification, along with a Capacity of 3 for additional vision enhancements (p.&nbsp;275). Attachment or removal takes only a Mi- nor Action. The Take Aim Minor Action must be used in order to gain the benefits of an imaging scope, though the dice pool bonus from that ac- tion is not gained for the first action of use. When you are using an imaging scope, your target cannot gain Edge by having a higher Defense Rating. Wireless bonus: The scope’s “line of sight” can be shared, allowing you to share what your scope sees with your team (and yourself if you’re using it to look around a corner).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Laser sight This device uses a laser beam to project a visible dot (normal, low-light, or thermographic) on the target. This increases the weapon’s Attack Rating by 1, not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. The laser sight can be mounted as either an underbarrel mount or top mount. Activating or deactivating a laser sight is a Minor Action. Note that in weapons with a laser sight includ- ed as standard equipment, this bonus is already calculated into the Attack Rating. Wireless bonus: The bonus to the Attack Rating increases to 2. You gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when you activate or deactivate the laser sight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Periscope This adjustable viewer attaches to a top mount and allows the user to target a weapon around cor-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ners, reducing the Cover IV dice pool penalty to &ndash;1 when using the Take Cover Action. A periscope can be upgraded with any of the vision enhance- ments noted on p.&nbsp;275. Capacity 3. Wireless bonus: The dice pool penalty noted above is reduced to 0.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Quick-draw holster An easy access holster designed to hold pistols and tasers. Use of the Quick-Draw holster pro- vides a bonus Minor Action when the Quick-Draw Action is taken.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shock pads A shock-absorbing pad situated on the rigid stock of a rifle, shotgun, or heavy weapon. It de- creases the Semi-Auto and Burst Fire Attack Rat- ing modifiers by 1.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Silencer A barrel-mounted accessory for reducing the sound and flash of firing a weapon; not compatible with revolvers or shotguns. It increases the thresh- old on Perception tests by 2 to notice the weapon’s use or locate the weapon’s firer. Attaching or re- moving a silencer takes a Major Action. Wireless bonus: The silencer features systems and simple software that alerts you via AR if some- one nearby moves quickly in response to the sound of the silenced weapon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Smart firing platform A robotic tripod equipped with a mechanized pivot that allows for a 180-degree firing arc and a 60-degree inclination. It can mount one smart- gun-equipped weapon to the platform. The weapon will be fired by the platform’s onboard pilot (Device Rating 3), using a pre-programmed Targeting Auto- soft (Rating 3). It can be upgraded with additional autosofts, usually a Clearsight program. You need to set the parameters of who exactly the platform should and shouldn’t shoot at, which are followed by the platform’s pilot. The platform negates the At- tack Rating adjustments for Semi-Auto and Burst Fire and offers a +3 Attack Rating for Full-Auto. It has an Initiative rank of Pilot x 4, 3D6 Initiative Dice, 4 Minor Actions, and 1 Major Action. Wireless bonus: You can fire the mounted weapon remotely using an implanted smartlink using VR, replacing the system’s dice pools with your own.</p>

<p class="calibre1">caseless vs.&nbsp;cased Caseless ammo is rare these days, with the corps wanting to track who’s doing what against them. With no shell casing it’s one less thing to help track down a cul- prit. They also install a hardened stealth micro-RFID in half of all the cased rounds they produce that activates when fired and alerts local authorities. Most runners have a tech guy who waves his magic wand (tag eraser) over their ammo and fries the tags, but it doesn’t always work, and not everyone owns a tag eraser. Erasing tags requires a tag eraser. Make an Electron- ics + Logic (2, 1 minute) for every ten rounds being erased.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Flechette The payload of a flechette (fl) round is made up of tiny, tightly packed fin-stabilized metal slivers or metal balls (depending on the weapon). They have some spread, making them more likely to catch a soft spot, but they’re small compared to other ammo, delivering less kinetic energy to the target.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Injection darts Each injection dart carries a single dose of a drug or toxin (purchased separately). Successful delivery of the payload requires at least one net hit on the At- tack test versus an unarmored target or two net hits against a target with any form of armor, be it worn or natural.

Minigrenades are specifically designed for use with grenade launchers, set to arm when they have traveled five meters and explode on impact or with an airburst link (p.&nbsp;259).

<p class="calibre1">The damage from grenades becomes less the farther away from them you are. The DV entry for grenades lists the initial damage for those closest to the grenade, within a meter, called Ground Zero, then two categories of lesser damage for those in Close and Near Range, with the damage limited to a maximum range of the Blast attribute. Use the Athletics skill + Agility when throw- ing grenades, or Exotic Weapons (Launcher) + Agility when launching a grenade from a grenade launcher. Follow the rules for Blast Attacks, p. 114. Grenades and similar explosives can also be rigged with a tripwire to be set up as a basic boo- by trap. This requires an Engineering + Logic (8, 1 Major Action) Extended Test. All grenades have the following wireless fea- ture: You can use the wireless link trigger for your grenades via an ARO on your commlink even if you don’t have direct neural interface.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stun grenade Often called flash-bangs, these grenades ex- plode to create a bright, loud, shocking blast that stuns and staggers anyone in their range. Along with the damage, those in the Blast of a Stun gre- nade suffer the Blinded I, Deafened I, and Dazed Status Effect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Flash-pak This is an electronic box, ten centimeters by ten centimeters on its face and two centimeters thick, containing a set of micro-flashes on each side de- signed to fire in random strobing sequence to con- fuse opponents. Anyone in the range of a flash-pak and using standard vision receives the Blinded sta- tus (p.&nbsp;51) indicated in the DV chart on all tests that include vision due to the strobe effect. Using low-light causes the status to shift up one level. Flare compensation drops the status down one level. The flash-pak has ten charges and uses one charge per combat round. Plugged in, it recharges one charge every ten seconds. Wireless bonus: The strobe sequence can avoid directing strong flashes at the subscribed character,</p>
<p class="calibre1">preventing any Status Effect for them. The device can recharge by induction, regaining one charge per hour.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Smoke/thermal smoke Similar to the gas grenade, a smoke grenade releases a cloud of smoke instead of toxic gas. The cloud obscures vision, inflicting the Blinded I Status for anyone acting through the smoke and Blinded II for anyone trying to act from within the smoke. The cloud lasts for approximately 10 com- bat rounds based on the Gas Attack rules, p.&nbsp;116.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rockets and Missiles Rockets are launched projectiles with stabi- lizing fins, a propulsion system, and a warhead. Missiles are rockets that carry internal guidance systems, with sensor packages adding their rating to the attack roll, since they can adjust their trajec- tory in flight (also reflected in their Attack Rating). Rules for firing rockets and missiles are on p. 114. Rockets and missiles are set to arm when they have traveled 10 meters from their point of origin and explode on impact or with an airburst link (p.&nbsp;259).

<p class="calibre1">Conventional Explosives Explosives are primarily used to damage struc- tures, but metahumankind has come up with many ways to have them hurt body structures. You can use the Engineering skill to prepare explosives (see p.&nbsp;117).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Conventional Explosives A range of explosive compounds, both solid and liquid, are available to the construction indus- try for all their destructive needs. All explosives are bought as an Explosive Package with a set Rating that encompasses an amalgamation of their power</p>
<p class="calibre1">and quantity without defining either. They cannot be combined between rating ranges due to the dif- ferences in compounds and quantities. This makes using them simpler.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Plastic These highly stable, moldable, and adhesive explosive compounds are military grade. They’re ideal for certain jobs, like breaching walls and are usually color-tinted to indicate the level of current needed to detonate them, from the black of mag- netic-field induction to the chalky white of 440- volt industrial explosives. We say usually because some bomb makers like to dye their devices to throw off bomb techs trying to disarm their device.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Armor Due to materials advances modern armor can be lightweight, flexible, and concealable. Armor adds to Defense Rating, and multiple items do not stack unless noted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Leather jacket/duster Synthleather is the norm for street types, and this type of jacket (waist-length to duster) never goes out of style. It even offers a modicum of protection.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Actioneer business clothes This is the fancy armored suit popular among Mr.&nbsp;Johnsons, faces, and fixers looking for a little protection coupled with style. It features a conceal- able holster (see p.&nbsp;259) in the jacket.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Armor clothing Lightweight ballistic weave makes these gar- ments almost impossible to detect as armor. It doesn’t provide as much protection as real armor, but it comes in just about any style you desire.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Armor jacket Available in all manner of styles, it offers good protection without catching too much attention. But don’t think of wearing one to a social event or government building.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Armor vest A flexible-wrap vest designed to be worn under regular clothing without displaying any bulk.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chameleon suit A head-to-toe suit with a ruthenium polymer coating supported by a sensor suite, allowing it to scan its surroundings and replicate the images at the proper perspectives. You gain a bonus Edge when performing Stealth tests to hide while wear- ing an active suit. Wireless bonus: The suit also raises your Defense Rating by 2 thanks to improved hiding ability.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Full body armor This armor is worn by military and security per- sonnel around the world for heavy-duty jobs. It is styled for intimidation but includes an array of tac- tical holsters, pouches, and webbing for deadly effi- ciency. It’s going to draw attention, just so you know. The suit can be modified for environmental adapta- tion (hot or cold environments) or chemically sealed to completely protect the wearer from toxic environ- ments and attacks. The suit comes with a helmet with a Capacity of 6 for vision or audio enhancements.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lined coat This cowboy-style duster has been consistently popular on the mean streets of the world’s sprawls for the past fifty years. Besides being protective, the armored trenchcoat provides a bonus Edge against tests to spot items hidden underneath.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Electronics Commlinks Commlinks are universal communication de- vices used by virtually everyone all the time. They come in a variety of shapes and styles, with some included in augmentations and articles of clothing. Even the most basic of them include AR Matrix browsing capability, telephone, vidphone, text, music players, micro trid-projectors, touchscreen displays, high-resolution video and still-image cameras, image/text and RFID tag scanners, built- in GPS guidance systems, chip players, credstick</p>
<p class="calibre1">readers, retractable earbuds, voice access, and text- to-speech and speech-to-text technologies. They also offer plenty of other add-on features.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cyberdecks When the corps cracked down on the Matrix, working hard to prevent illicit use of their pretty new system, the cyberdeck re-emerged as the tool for messing with innards of the Matrix. They are powerful devices in the hands of a skilled decker. The newest models look something like medieval bracers, only less bulky. They’re worn on the wrist and can project keyboards (or whatever interface the user prefers) onto the user’s arm, a nearby sur- face, or just the air around them. Some models have screens; most don’t. They tend to look like a block with a series of ports, though many deckers connect to their deck wirelessly. For more infor- mation about them, see Devices, p.&nbsp;174. All cyber- decks include hot-sim modules.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Accessories Unless otherwise noted, these accessories are compatible with commlinks, cyberdecks, and (with GM permission) other electronic devices. All periph- eral accessories are wireless, and unless slaved prop-</p>

<p class="calibre1">headjammer from yourself is an Athletics + Agil- ity (5) test, requiring a Major Action. Failure to succeed in any of these actions could activate any additional anti-tamper devices this jammer may be attached to. Headjammers are available with ratings from 1 to 6.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jammer This device floods the airwaves with electro- magnetic jamming signals to block out wireless and radio communication. The jammer generates noise equal to its Device Rating. The area jammer affects a spherical area&mdash;its rating is reduced by 1 for every 10 meters from the center. The direction- al jammer affects a conical area with a thirty-de- gree spread&mdash;its rating is reduced by 1 for every 30 meters from the center. The jammer only affects devices that are within the jamming area, but it affects all of them. Walls and other obstacles may prevent the jamming signal from spreading or re- duce its effect (gamemaster’s discretion). Jammers are available with ratings from 1 to 6. Wireless bonus: You can set your jammer to not interfere with devices and personas you designate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Micro-transceiver This short-range communicator doesn’t do</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything special&mdash;it just lets you communicate by voice with other micro-transceivers and com- mlinks that you link together, within a kilometer. The micro-transceiver consists of an earbud and an adhesive subvocal microphone (p.&nbsp;268). A mi- cro-tranceiver has a Device Rating of 2 and is best used slaved to a better device when used for secure communications.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tag eraser This handheld device creates an electromag- netic pulse for burning out RFID tags and oth- er unshielded electronics. To use it, bring the eraser within five millimeters of any electronic device and push the button, instantly delivering 10 boxes of Matrix damage (resisted normal- ly). The short range makes it impossible to use on targets such as vehicles, most drones, ma- glocks, and cyberware. The tag eraser has one charge but can be fully recharged in ten seconds if plugged in. Wireless bonus: The tag eraser recharges fully in an hour by induction.</p>

Wireless bonus: As the device scans and chirps out local noise, the white noise generator’s effec- tive radius is tripled.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Software Software can be purchased as Matrix down- load or less commonly on a datachip from phys- ical stores. Datasofts, mapsofts, shopsofts, and tutorsofts can be easily stored and accessed on a commlink, dataterminal, or cyberdeck.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Autosofts Programs used in the operation drones. For more info, see p.&nbsp;201.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Programs These are programs both regular people and hackers use to make their way through the Ma- trix. Their functions are described on p.&nbsp;184. They come in two types&mdash;basic and hacking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Datasofts Datasofts are like mini-library sections. Each holds a database on a specific subject (i.e., a Knowledge skill). An appropriate datasoft pro- vides you with a narrow version of a Knowl- edge skill&mdash;for example, since Seattle Gangs is a Knowledge skill, a datasoft might cover the An- cients or the Halloweeners, or might just focus on Puyallup gangs. The datasoft is then used the same as a Knowledge skill (p.&nbsp;97).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mapsofts Mapsofts are downloaded data featuring de- tailed information about a single specific area approximately 5,000 square kilometers. It in- cludes everything: streets, business/residential listings, topographical, census, GPS, and en- vironmental data. An interactive interface al- lows you to quickly determine the best routes and directions, locate the nearest spot of your choice, or create your own customized maps. If a wireless link is maintained, the map auto- matically self-updates with the latest data from GridGuide. Of course, this feature also means that the mapsoft can be used to track your lo- cation. Mapsofts add a +1 dice pool bonus on any test to find directions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shopsofts Shopping programs like Clothes Horse, Ca- veat Emptor, and Guns Near Me provide pric- ing breakdowns and user reviews for compar- ison shopping purposes for standard goods. An appropriate shopsoft&mdash;one exists for each type of product like electronics, firearms, melee weapons, armor, etc.&mdash;provides a +1 dice pool bonus to Influence tests you make to buy and sell items.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Skillsofts A skillsoft program is a recorded skill that includes both digital knowledge and muscle memory data. When used in conjunction with the proper augmentations (a skilljack for know- softs and linguasofts; a skillwire system for ac- tivesofts), skillsofts let you know and do things you’ve never otherwise learned. When a skill test is called for, the character may use the skillsoft rating in place of the skill. Downside: Tests made with a skillsoft may not be boosted with Edge in any way. All skillsofts are available in ratings from 1 to 6.</p>

<p class="calibre1">numbers and letters connected to biometric and personal history data in the Global SIN Registry. Most citizens, be they national or megacorporate, receive their SINs at birth and carry them until they die. Not having a SIN means living outside the system with restricted or nonexistent civ- il rights. Shadowrunners by default are SINless, having a SIN only if they have the SINner quality (p.&nbsp;78). Most runners don’t have one, either be- cause they were unfortunate enough to be born poor, or because they lost it or ditched it some- where along the way. SINs are digital, not physi- cal objects. They exist on your commlink as data and are broadcasted as part of your PAN but are only accessible to legal entities with special access codes. Getting by without a SIN can be a pain, so most runners settle for the next best thing: a fake. High quality fakes are difficult for the Man to spot; low quality fakes are … less good. The rating of the fake SIN is used in tests against verification sys- tems, and SINs are available in ratings from 1 to 6. Just like a real SIN, anytime you use a fake SIN for legitimate activity, you leave a datatrail in your wake. The fact that criminal activities can be tracked to fake SINs makes fake SINs inherent- ly disposable. Most runners operate two or more fake SINs at a time&mdash;one for legal activity like pay- ing rent and going shopping, another for shadier activity, and possibly a third to be used only when it’s time to get the hell outta Dodge.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fake License For those who can’t or won’t go through the standard legal channels, fake licenses are avail- able for all kinds of restricted items and activities. Items with no letter next to their availability don’t require licenses. Items that are Illegal (I) to own privately have no license available. Licenses, there- fore, are for Licensed (L) items. Each type of item/ activity permission requires a separate license. Things that require licenses include hunting (bow and rifle), possession of a firearm, concealed car- ry of a firearm (separate license), spellcasting, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">any Licensed gear or augmentations. Just as SINs essentially exist on your commlink, fake licenses exist on your SIN and are linked to it. When you buy a fake concealed-carry license, you don’t buy it for Murderman the professional shadowrunner, you buy it for Joe Chummer, one of Murderman’s fake SINs. Each license must be assigned to a par- ticular (fake) SIN of the player’s choosing. Use the fake license’s rating against verification systems. License ratings cannot exceed the rating of the fake SIN to which they are attached, and like fake SINs are available in ratings from 1 to 6.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tools Building and repairing items, including people, requires the right tools for the job. Tools must be bought separately for a specific skill (for example, an Electronics toolkit, a Biotech shop, an Engi- neering facility, etc.).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kit A kit is portable and contains the basic gear to make standard repairs. Without at least a kit in the field, a skill may not be able to be used actively.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shop A shop is transportable in the back of a van and contains more advanced tools for building and repairing. A shop offers a +1 dice pool modifier for appropriate tests on site. Shops are stocked with standard spare parts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Facility A facility needs a building and is immobile be- cause of the bulky and heavy machines involved, but it can be used for very advanced constructions and modifications.

All devices have wireless capability and default to its use, but you can use a universal data cable for most of them. Devices have a Capacity that allows you to add vision enhancements. You can never have en- hancements whose capacity cost totals more than the device’s Capacity. Some of these devices are worn, while others are external sensor devices or even attached to weapons.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Binoculars Typically handheld, binoculars come with built- in vision magnification. Binoculars are available in optical (which can only take the image link enhancement) and electronic versions (which can take a variety of vision enhancements). Spellcast- ers can use optical binoculars for casting spells at distant targets.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Motion sensor This sensor uses a mix of ultrasound and low-power infrared to detect motion and drastic changes in the ambient temperature. Maximum range is twenty-five meters.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Olfactory scanner The olfactory sensor picks up and analyzes molecules in the air. It works in the same way as the olfactory booster cyberware (p.&nbsp;283).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ultrasound The ultrasound accessory consists of an emitter that sends out continuous ultrasonic pulses and a receiver that picks up the echoes of these pulses to create a topographic ultrasound map. Ultrasound is perfect to get textures, calculate distances be- tween objects, and pick up things otherwise invis- ible to the naked eye (take that, Invisibility spell!). It can’t determine colors or brightness but operates in total darkness perfectly. It also can’t penetrate materials like glass that would be transparent to optical sensors. You can set it to a passive mode, where it doesn’t emit ultrasonic pulses but still picks up ultrasound from outside sources, such as motion sensors or someone else’s ultrasound sen- sors on active mode (or bats). Using the ultrasound sensor in dim light or total darkness offers a bonus Edge if opponents can’t see, offers a bonus Edge against targets who are invisible, and provides the ability to navigate in complete darkness by expending an extra Minor Action for movement.</p>

For more information about maglocks and their options, see Maglocks, p.&nbsp;241. They have a rating between 1 and 9.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Restraints Standard metal restraints (Structure 10) come with a mechanical or a wireless-controlled lock (Barriers, p.&nbsp;111). Modern plasteel restraints (Structure 12) are flash-fused and remain in place until the subject is cut free. Disposable plastic straps (Structure 6) are lightweight and easy to carry in bundles. Containment manacles are metal (Struc- ture 10) and attached to a prisoner’s wrists and ankles to prevent them from moving faster than a shuffle (two-meter Move, three-meter Sprint) or extending a cyber-implant weapon.</p>

<p class="calibre1">with a one-hour clean-air supply (replacements cost 40 nuyen) and can be attached to larger air tanks. It cannot be combined with a regular respirator. Wireless bonus: The gas mask analyzes and gives you information about the surrounding air that you’re not breathing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gecko tape gloves The outer layer of these gloves is made of a special dry adhesive that incorporates millions of fine micro- scopic hairs that bond to other surfaces. Individually, these bonding forces are tiny, but combined they’re strong enough to attach a troll, upside down, to the ceiling. Gecko tape gloves come as a set that includes gloves, kneepads, and slip-on-soles. You get to use as- sisted climbing (p.&nbsp;93) when you’re wearing the set. Gecko tape gloves are useless when they’re wet. Wireless bonus: The adhesive outer layer can be temporarily neutralized with a wireless signal, useful for getting the gloves on and off without getting them stuck to yourself or each other.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hazmat suit The hazmat suit covers your whole body and includes an internal air tank with four hours of air. It provides you with a chemical seal (p.&nbsp;266) and protects you from Contact- and Inhalation-vec- tor toxin attacks (see Toxins and Drugs, p.&nbsp;121). Hazmat suits come standard with a sensor slot, usually used for a Geiger counter (see Sensors, p.&nbsp;276). The sensor is purchased separately. Wireless bonus: The suit analyzes and transmits information about the environment that you’re not touching or breathing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Light stick Bend, snap, and shake it to produce three hours of soft chemical illumination that covers a ten-me- ter radius.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magnesium torch/flare Strike and activate for five minutes of bright torchlight extending out to 20 meters. Hitting someone with the end causes 3P Fire damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Microflare launcher The flare launcher shoots colored flares 200 meters into the air, illuminating an area the size of a city block for a couple of minutes and negating the advantage of poor or low lighting. If you shoot it at someone, it’s an untrained skill check; the mi- cro flare deals 3P Fire damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rappelling gloves These gloves are made of a special fabric that allows you to get a tighter grip on a grapple line, giving you a bonus Edge on all tests to hold your grip on the line. These gloves are necessary in order to use microwire or stealth rope (p.&nbsp;280) without gruesomely slicing your hands apart as you slide down it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Respirator A respirator is a filter mask worn over the mouth and nose that protects against Inhalation-vector toxins (see Toxins and Drugs, p.&nbsp;121). The respira- tor adds its rating as a dice pool bonus on tests to resist chemicals with an Inhalation vector.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Survival kit A rugged bag full of survival essentials. The bag includes a knife, lighter, matches, compass, string saw, lightweight thermal blanket, seven days’ worth of soy ration bars, a water-purification unit, fishing line and a hook, and a smattering of other survival equipment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grapple Gun This gun shoots a grappling hook and attached rope up to sixty meters or one hundred meters depending on the type of line. The Firearms test threshold to hit your desired target point is (Range in meters/20, rounded up). It comes equipped with an internal winch to retract the grapple or pull up small loads of up to ten kilograms. Micro rope can be fired up to 100 meters and supports a weight of up to 100 kilograms; standard and stealth ropes only reach sixty meters but can support a weight of up to 400 kilos. May be used untrained as a weapon (AR: 1, DV: 1S).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Microwire This rope is made of an extremely thin (nearly monofilament) and resilient polymer; a great length of it can be stored in a very small compartment,</p>

<p class="calibre1">and it is very difficult to see (Perception threshold 6). The downside is that it can only be grabbed with special protective rappelling gloves without slicing straight through the climber’s hands, inflict- ing 5P damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Myomeric rope Made of a special fiber, this rope’s movement can be controlled remotely (over a maximum length of thirty meters). For example, the control- ler can wind it like a snake to reach around an obstacle or tie to a ledge. The rope moves at a rate of two meters per combat round.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stealth rope and catalyst stick When stealth rope is touched with the catalyst stick, the chemical reaction that is triggered crum- bles the rope to dust within seconds, leaving al- most no trace. The catalyst stick is reusable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Biotech Basics Biomonitor This small device constantly measures heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. It can also analyze blood, sweat, and skin samples. Used by medical services and patients who need to mon- itor their own health, biomonitors can be worn as an armband or wristband or integrated into cloth- ing or commlinks. Wireless bonus: The biomonitor shares infor- mation with other wireless devices you designate and can auto-alert DocWagon or another ambu- lance service if your life signs reach certain thresh- olds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Disposable syringe Made of plastic with a metal needle, syringes are intended for a single use. Syringes can be used to apply Injection-vector toxins. An uncooperative victim might need to be immobilized or at least grappled first.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Medkit The medkit includes drug supplies, bandages, tools, and a (talkative) doctor expert system that can advise the user on techniques to handle most typical medical emergencies (including fractures, gunshot wounds, chemical wounds, and poisoning, as well as offering advice for the treatment of shock, handling blood loss, and of course performing re- suscitations). The medkit counts as Kit for Biotech tests. For rules on using a medkit, see p.&nbsp;119. Wireless bonus: The medkit provides a +1 dice pool modifier to healing tests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Supplies Medkit supplies need to be purchased after each use or extras can be purchased. Up to five sets of supplies can be stored in the medkit’s case; sets beyond that will need to be carried elsewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre1">DocWagon Contracts Don’t leave home without it! DocWagon offers first-class emergency medical care on a twenty- four-hour basis, and they come to you! Four con- tract service levels are available: basic, gold, plati- num, and super-platinum. A DocWagon contract requires the filing of tis- sue samples (held in a secure vault staffed by bond- ed guards, spiders, and mages) and comes with a biomonitor RFID tag implant or wristband that can be activated to call for help and then to serve as a homing beacon for DocWagon ambulances and fast-response choppers in the area. Breaking the band will also alert DocWagon representatives. Upon receiving a call from a contract-holder, DocWagon franchises guarantee arrival of an armed trauma team in less than ten minutes (within covered metropolitan regions), or else the emergency medical care is free. Resuscitation service carries a high pre- mium (5,000 nuyen), as does High Threat Response (HTR) service (5,000 nuyen). In the latter case, the client or their next of kin is expected to pay medi- cal bills up to and including death compensation for DocWagon employees (20,000 nuyen per cold body). Gold service includes one free resuscitation per year, a fifty percent reduction on HTR service charges, and a ten percent discount on extended care. Platinum service includes four free resuscita- tions per year and a fifty percent discount on ex- tended care; there is no charge for HTR services, but employee death compensation still applies. Super-platinum subscribers are entitled to five free resuscitations a year and do not have to pay for HTR services or death compensation. DocWagon does not respond to calls on extra- territorial government or corporate property with- out permission from the controlling authority, but they will arrive at the border within the required 10 minutes!</p>

<p class="calibre1">Slap Patches Slap patches are adhesive dermal drug dispens- ers. They are applied directly to skin. Applying a slap patch to an unwilling patient requires a suc- cessful Close Combat attack (which deals no dam- age), which may be tricky if your target doesn’t have much exposed skin, requiring a Called Shot Minor Action to hit bare flesh.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Antidote patch The antidote patch cancels or negates the Poi- soned Status for a broad range of toxins. If a spe- cific toxin or drug is extremely rare, the gamemas- ter may require a specific Antidote patch just for that substance (see Toxins and Drugs, p.&nbsp;121).</p>

The effect lasts for (rating x 10) min- utes&mdash;after that period of time, the patient takes (rating + 1) unresisted Stun damage (which may well become Overflow by that point). While a stimulant patch is in effect, the character is unable to rest.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Surgery/recovery Getting cyberware and bioware requires surgery and therefore damage. When you have an augmen- tation implanted, your Physical and Stun Condition Monitors each take a number of boxes of damage equal to the item’s Essence Cost x 3 (minimum 1 box, but never into Overflow). Most cyberclinics and body shops offer recovery rooms for patients to rest and heal up after cybersurgery, but beware the sterility and cleanliness of the less-reputable chop shops. The price of these services is not included with the cyberware and should be added on if the runner wishes to use them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Augmentation overdrive The systems can be boosted, but there’s always a potential for problems when they do. Spend a Minor Action to set a single system to overdrive, increasing the rating of any attribute-boosting augmentation by two for a single roll. One of the bonus dice must be a wild die. Glitches in over- drive cause the affected system to cramp up and shut down for a number of combat rounds equal to the rating. Critical glitches seize the muscle and reduce the affected attribute to 0 for a number of combat rounds equal to the rating.</p>
<p class="calibre1">GEAR //</p>
<p class="calibre1">Headware Commlink The implanted version of the commlink (p.&nbsp;267) comes with a sim module at no additional cost. An integral headware commlink is popular with cor- porate operatives, company men, and sararimen on the go. Generally speaking, commlinks with a De- vice Rating of less than 5 are not installed inside your skull, for security reasons. A bricked headware commlink causes 6P damage resisted by Body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Control Rig This implant harnesses the raw data-coordinat- ing and synchronization power of the middle brain for the express purpose of directly manipulating rigged vehicles and drones (and other devices with rigger interface, like turrets). It has a built-in sim module, allowing DNI with other devices. It also comes with a universal data connector and about a meter of retractable cable that functions like a datajack. When you’re jumped into a vehicle or drone, the control rig provides its rating as a dice pool bonus on all vehicle skill tests and a bonus point of Edge.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cortex bomb An illegal method of coercion, cranial bombs come in three flavors: kink, microbomb, and area bomb. Kink bombs are designed to damage only part of the victim’s head, either rendering specific headware useless or damaging the brain to cause blindness, stuttering, hearing loss, or some other trauma (5P, resisted with Body; status as appropri- ate). Of course, sometimes when something in your head explodes, things don’t go exactly as planned and the result is a bit … much. The microbomb ver- sion is just powerful enough to kill the unfortunate bearer (18P, resisted with Body). Area cranial bombs kill the victim (microbomb damage to victim), and they also affect a blast area exactly like a fragmen- tation grenade (p.&nbsp;263) resisted separately from the initial microbomb damage. The bombs can be re- mote- or time-detonated, or even set to discharge by sound recognition. If installed in cyberlimbs, these bombs are designed to destroy specific components (kink), the entire limb (regular), or blast the area and damage the bearer (microbomb).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cyberdeck Simply put, you’ve got a deck in your body. This is very convenient for the hacker on the go and is often sported by G-men and military deck- ers. Bricking a headware deck causes 8P damage resisted with Body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cyberjacks As the Matrix protocols have become stiffer and stiffer, work has raced forward to keep hackers operating. The latest tool that has advanced quick- ly from neat to necessary is the cyberjack, which represents one of those times when shadowrunners turned the tables on the corps. Based on corporate research on technomancers, the cyberjack harness- es the immense processing power of the brain to take on Matrix protocols and encryption schemes. It happened rapidly, but it now seems that a deck- er without a cyberjack is about as effective as one without a cyberdeck. The cyberjack provides a decker’s primary defense against hacking, offering Data Processing and Firewall ratings that cyber- decks no longer possess, and they also function as a standard datajack. Cyberjacks also allow special Matrix Edge Actions (p.&nbsp;175).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Datajack A datajack gives you a direct neural interface. It also comes with a retractable spool of micro-cable (a meter long) that lets you directly interface with any electronic device via a universal access cable. Datajacks are equipped with their own cache of storage memory for downloading or saving files. Two datajack users can string a fiberoptic cable between themselves to conduct a private mental communication immune to radio interception or eavesdropping.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Datalock This special datajack is popular with couriers, spies, diplomatic aids, and executive liaisons. Ef- fectively, it turns the character in whom it is in- stalled into a walking data safe. The datalock has a Device Rating equal to its own rating, and it protects the data from anyone not authorized to access it (possibly including you). Datalocks are not wireless enabled; they can only be accessed via universal data connector. In fact, the bearer of the implant doesn’t have mental access to the data&mdash; they’re only a carrier.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Olfactory booster This cybersnout enhances, identifies, and re- cords smells, and can play them back later. The massively enhanced olfactory capabilities of a sniffer open up a whole new world of sensory data to you&mdash;you’ll be able to sense things that ordi- narily only a scenthound would. You can smell people’s emotions in their sweat (and if applicable, the maker’s mark of their tailored pheromones), traces of ammunition propellant, explosives, or biological and chemical warfare compounds&mdash;the list goes on and on. A cut-off function allows you to completely ignore intense odors, possibly the</p>

It can also run activesofts, but they only act as Knowledge Skills unless you have skillwires (p.&nbsp;287). The total of all skills running on a skilljack cannot exceed its rating x 2, and the maximum rating for a single skill is the skilljack’s rating. Starting skills from storage and stopping skills doesn’t require an action. You can’t use Edge with skills you have through a skilljack. Wireless bonus: The extra boost from the Ma- trix increases the total Rating limit to the skill- jack’s rating x 4, and Edge can be used in associ- ated tests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Taste booster The taste booster performs the same function as the olfactory booster, except that it enhances your taste buds. The taste booster also lets you experience gustatory data in AR and VR environ- ments with a “taste track”&mdash;caveat emptor on that one, chummer. The user gains a bonus Edge for all taste-based Perception tests, but it goes away if they do not use it on that test.

A fingertip compartment allows the storage of micro-sized items, like a micro-drone, RFID tag, or datachip. Inserting or removing an ob- ject takes a Major Action. Items held within are com- pletely concealed, and the compartment itself has a Concealability threshold of 8. One popular trick is to use a fingertip compartment to hold a monofila- ment whip (p.&nbsp;249), with the fingertip acting as con- trol weight. Extending a monofilament whip from a fingertip compartment takes a Minor Action, while spooling it back up requires a Major Action. Wireless bonus: Inserting or removing an item in a fingertip compartment takes a Minor Action, including spooling up a monofilament whip.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grapple gun This is an implanted version of the grapple gun described on p.&nbsp;280. Its internal storage holds sixty meters of microwire.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Internal air tank The internal air tank replaces part of one lung with a pressurized internal air reserve that allows you to hold your breath for up to (rating) hours. This allows extended underwater operations and complete protection from Inhalation-vector toxin attacks as long as you’re holding your breath. Ac- tivating or deactivating the tank is a Minor Action. Refilling the air tank with pressurized air through an intake valve (located under your ribcage) takes five minutes, or you can refill it through six hours of normal breathing. Wireless bonus: You gain an extra Minor Ac- tion during any turn when you activate or deac- tivate the tank. You’re always aware of the tank’s exact air level and purity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Muscle replacement Vat-grown synthetic muscles replace or aug- ment your own, and calcium treatments and skeletal reinforcement contribute to your overall strength. It increases both your Strength and Agil- ity attributes by its rating. It cannot be combined with other augmentations to the muscles, includ- ing muscle augmentation or muscle toner bioware.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reaction enhancers By replacing specific, isolated vertebrae of your spinal column with segments of superconducting</p>
<p class="calibre1">material, your reactions to events become quick- er. Add the rating of reaction enhancers to your Reaction attribute (and remember to adjust your Initiative Score accordingly). Reaction enhancers are incompatible with all other enhancements to Reaction, including wired reflexes. Wireless bonus: Reaction enhancers are com- patible with a wireless wired reflexes system.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Skillwires Skillwires are a system of neuromuscular con- trollers that overlay the body’s natural nervous system; they are capable of aiding or completely overriding muscular movement, controlled by the muscle memory played through a skilljack (p.&nbsp;284). This system allows you to use activesofts with a rating up to your skillwire’s rating, but only if that activesoft is running on your implanted skilljack. Wireless bonus: With the skillwire’s memory cache expanded, all the skills you use with it re- ceive a +1 dice pool modifier.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Smuggling compartment For items that won’t fit in a fingertip but you still can’t afford to have found, smuggling com- partments can be placed in parts of the body that can be easily hollowed out/replaced. This includes ribs and the space between them, hip bones, shoul- der blades, and so forth. These compartments allow the storage of small and miniature items (nothing bigger than a light pistol typically; your gamemas- ter will let you know if something’s too big). The compartment has a Concealability threshold of 8. Inserting or retrieving an object requires a Major Action. Wireless Bonus: Inserting or retrieving an ob- ject takes a Minor Action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wired reflexes This highly invasive, painful, life-changing operation adds a multitude of neural boosters and adrenaline stimulators in strategic locations throughout your body to catapult you into a whole new world where everything around you seems to move in slow motion. The system includes both manual and wireless triggers to turn the wired reflexes on and off; activating or deactivating the trigger manually requires a Major Action, while doing so wirelessly is a Minor Action. When ac- tivated, each rating point of wired reflexes gives you +1 Reaction (and accompanying bonus to your Initiative Score), 1 additional Initiative Die, and 1 additional Minor Action. Wired reflexes are incompatible with augmentations that affect Reac- tion or Initiative. Wireless Bonus: The system is compatible with wireless reaction enhancers, and activation or de- activation of the system requires a Minor Action.</p>

<p class="calibre1">in the process. For example, if a cyberarm has an increase to the user’s Strength, that would increase their damage when doing an unarmed attack with that arm, but not when kicking. If an activity could reasonably be interpreted to use the whole body in some way (e.g., sprinting, climbing, swimming), then the cyberlimb increase would not apply. Note that Strength and Agility increases have no effect when they are included in a cyberskull.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gyro mount This functions the same as the gyro mount weapon accessory, p.&nbsp;259.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Slide This functions the same as a hidden arm slide, p.&nbsp;260.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Holster It holds a weapon&mdash;for convenience, not con- cealment. The holster should be reasonably appro- priate to the size of the limb.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hydraulic jacks For these to function properly, you need two of them, one in each leg, and they need to have identi- cal ratings. The user can make Jumping tests (Ath- letics + Strength) and add the rating of the jacks to the dice pool of the test. Each hit adds 0.1 meter to a vertical leap and 0.2 meters to a horizontal leap.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Smuggling compartment This functions like the smuggling compartment listed on p.&nbsp;287.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cyber Implant Weapons Weapons can be implanted into cyberlimbs, costing capacity, or directly into flesh, costing Es- sence. Many of them are there for different classes of firearms. In those cases, the implant only makes the space, and the firearm has to be purchased separately. All forms of pistols increase their Con- cealability by 2 when they are implanted; larger guns receive no change, as they are still pretty no- ticeable, even when they’re implanted. Rifles and Sniper Rifles cannot be implanted. All implanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">GEAR //</p>
<p class="calibre1">weapons can be readied with the Quick Draw Mi- nor Action. The only modifications or accessories implant- ed firearms can accept are laser sights and silenc- ers/sound suppressors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Specialized Weapons Cyberjaw This adds extra biting power for those who like a special, close-in form of violence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardening Through this process, the skin/limb is hardened to make it more club-like and damaging. When at- tacking unarmed, the user has a DV of 3P (increase to 4P if Strength is 7 or greater) and a Close Attack Rating of 6.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shock limb This limb has electrodes built in at strategic points that can deliver a taser-like jolt to targets. Hands are customarily used, but some fighters have grown fond of the shock kick, and stories proliferate of fighters engaging in street head butts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Handblade Available in regular and retractable models, the handblade is a simple blade built into the hand, placed opposite the thumb so it can be used with a swinging cut. When retracted, it has a Concealabil- ity threshold of 8.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hand razors Hand razors go under the fingernails or just replace them, all the better for clawing. As with handblades, the retractable model has a Conceal- ability threshold of 8.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spurs These are spikes placed on the wrist or the back of knuckles, designed to give a stabbing puncture to a punch or slap. The retractable model has a Concealability threshold of 8.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bioware Bioware is all organic material&mdash;it’s just better than the organic material you currently have. Its organic nature lessens the Essence cost, but the time it takes to grow increases its cost.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Adrenaline pump This enhanced gland is implanted in the lower abdomen, connected to both supradrenal glands. When dormant, the pump is merely a reservoir for adrenaline. When activated, a small muscular</p>
<p class="calibre1">sac contracts, sending a surge of concentrated adrenaline into the blood stream. Physical and emotional stress can force your pump to activate if you fail a Composure test (p.&nbsp;67); otherwise you can trigger it as a Minor Action. While the pump is active, you ignore injury modifiers, don’t fall unconscious even if your Stun Condition Monitor is filled, you can’t rest, and the adren- aline pump’s rating is added to your Strength, Agility, Reaction, and Willpower attributes. The pump works for (rating x 1D6) combat rounds, and it can’t be switched off early. When time’s up, you crash and take Stun damage equal to the number of combat rounds the pump was ac- tive (use unaugmented Body to resist the dam- age). After the effect’s end, your attribute values return to normal and you stop ignoring injury modifiers or unconsciousness from Stun damage. After use, the pump requires one hour to regen- erate its supply. During that time, it cannot be activated.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bone density augmentation The molecular structure of your bones is altered to increase density and tensile strength. Ligaments are strengthened, and the greater bone density in- creases your weight by fifteen percent. You gain its rating as extra Body when resisting physical dam- age. Your unarmed combat damage becomes Phys- ical and your Damage Value and Attack Rating increase per the table below. Bone density augmen- tation is incompatible with other augmentations to bones, including bone lacing cyberware.</p>
<p class="calibre1">bone density ratings RATING DV AR 1 +1 +1 2 +1 +2 3 +2 +2 4 +2 +3</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cat’s eyes These transgenic vat-grown implants are very literally cats’ eyes with a modified DNA profile and occipital connecting structures. The structure of cat’s eyes amplifies light and enhances night vi- sion, providing low-light vision (p.&nbsp;72). Cat’s eyes are slit and reflective, just like, well, a cat’s. This bioware is obviously not compatible with cyber- ware eye replacements, but individual vision en- hancements can be purchased.</p>

<p class="calibre1">augmentation lead to more fluid muscle and joint action. Enhanced articulation provides you with a +1 Agility and a bonus Edge when trying to move through cramped or confining spaces.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Muscle augmentation This biological weaving treatment enhances ex- isting muscle tissue, rather than replacing it with vat-grown muscles. Specially grown muscle cables are woven into existing muscle fibers, enhancing muscle mass and brute strength while providing a bulkier look. Muscle augmentation adds its rating to your Strength attribute. This bioware is incom- patible with augmentations that increase Strength, including the muscle replacement cyberware.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Muscle toner This treatment increases muscle-fiber elasticity in existing muscle tension, resulting in increased muscle tension and flexibility while providing a smooth and ropy physique. Muscle toner adds its rating to your Agility attribute. This bioware is in- compatible with augmentations that increase Agil- ity, including the muscle replacement cyberware and enhanced articulation bioware.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Orthoskin A web of biofibers in the skin provides the equivalent of personal armor while being virtual- ly indistinguishable from natural skin. Orthoskin provides a bonus equal to its rating to your De- fense Rating. Orthoskin cannot be combined with skin augmentations, including dermal plating.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Platelet factories Platelet factories increase your body’s ability to handle Physical damage by accelerating the pro- duction of platelets and their concentration in the blood, which helps stop bleeding faster. Any time you would take 2 or more boxes of damage to your Physical Condition Monitor, reduce the dam- age by 1 box.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Skin pocket This skin flap can be located anywhere on your body. A nerveless sheath of flesh concealed by the flap is perfect for hiding a small object&mdash;it’s a bio- ware version of a smuggling compartment (p.&nbsp;287). The skin pocket has a Concealability threshold of 10. It takes a Major Action to add or remove an item from a skin pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suprathyroid gland Placed on top of your existing thyroid gland, the suprathyroid gland supersedes the metabolic</p>
<p class="calibre1">functions of your thyroid. The enhanced metabo- lism produces more energy, supercharging you. In order to fuel your optimized metabolism, you’ll need to eat twice as much as normal. You get a +1 to your Agility, Body, Reaction, and Strength, along with a 25 percent boost in Lifestyle costs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Symbiotes Tailored micro-organisms in your bloodstream greatly enhance your healing. Add the rating of the symbiotes as a dice pool modifier on healing tests (Physical and Stun). However, the symbiotes have unusual dietary requirements that must be met to keep them alive. You need to pay (Rating x 200) nuyen per month for special symbiote food, although if you have a High Lifestyle or better, it’s covered. If they are not fed, they die in a month.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Synthacardium Artificially enhanced myocardium allows car- diovascular functions to be performed more effi- ciently, enabling the heart to keep the blood better oxygenated. The synthacardium adds its rating as a dice pool bonus to your Athletics skill tests for running, swimming, and climbing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tailored pheromones These pheromones are specially tailored to sub- tly influence others and can be released at will. Tailored pheromones increase your Charisma at- tribute by their Rating for Con and Influence tests, but only when the person you’re using them on is within a comfortable conversation range&mdash;if they can’t smell you, the pheromones don’t work. Tai- lored pheromones have no effect on magical abil- ities and tests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Toxin extractor A specially cultivated cluster of cells in your liver improves its filtering capabilities. The toxin extractor subtracts its rating from the threshold of Toxin Resistance tests (Toxins and Drugs, p.&nbsp;121).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tracheal filter Implanted at the top of your trachea, this or- gan can absorb airborne impurities and keep them from reaching your lungs. The filter adds its rating as a dice pool bonus to Toxin Resistance tests ver- sus Inhalation-vector toxins (Toxins and Drugs, p.&nbsp;121).</p>

<p class="calibre1">Enchanting focus Used for bolstering alchemy and focus creation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spell focus Spell foci fall into different sub-categories, namely counterspelling, spellcasting, ritual spell- casting, and sustaining. These functions are de- scribed on p.&nbsp;155. A different focus needs to be purchased for each category of spell (Health, Com- bat, Illusion, etc.), and each focus only provides the functions of its sub-category; there are no spell foci that cross all categories.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit focus Used to boost power when dealing with spirits. A different focus needs to be purchased for each type of spirit (Air, Fire, Kin, etc.).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weapon focus These are enchanted weapons so in tune with their owner they are like an extension of their own form in combat. They boost combat abilities and offer the ability to bypass some of the protections of the spiritual realm. A weapon focus is treated as a magical weapon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Metamagic focus Used to boost various metamagical abilities, a different focus needs to be purchased for each metamagical talent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Power focus Like a rip in the space between the astral and the physical world, this focus allows the caster to channel greater amounts of mana and boost their magic potential.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Qi focus These foci, often tattoos, are for boosting adept abilities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">GEAR //</p>
<p class="calibre1">Formulas Formulas are used to learn spells, alchemical preparations, and create foci. Every individual spell, preparation, and focus has its own formula that must be purchased separately. Costs are bro- ken down by category.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magical Lodge Materials Used to create a lodge for shamans or a her- metic circle for hermetics, the gear is sold with a bag that holds all the components. Once used, some items are reusable. To reuse parts, it takes a number of hours equal to the rating of the cir- cle or lodge to break down properly, and pur- chasing the new missing components cuts the cost in half.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reagents These powders are used to mitigate some of the difficulties inherent in using magic in the Sixth World. They are sold by the dram and lose potency after use.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Weapon Mounts Vehicles may be equipped with a number of weapon mounts equal to their unaugmented Body / 3. Standard weapon mounts may hold any Assault Rifle or smaller weapon and 250 rounds of ammo. Heavy weapon mounts count as two weapon mounts and can hold any weapon along with 500 rounds of belted ammo or up to (Body) rockets/mis- siles. All weapon mounts are operated remotely and can target a ninety-degree arc of fire (horizontal and vertical). Manual operation can be added, but only for vehicles, not drones, and at extra cost.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rigger Interface Every vehicle in Shadowrun comes with Grid- Guide and an autonomous driving system. Even bikes&mdash;though they fall over when they stop with-</p>
<p class="calibre1">out a rider. The rigger interface is what allows a rigger to jump in and actually feel as if they are the vehicle instead of a metahuman. Hands and feet become wheels, wings, or rotors; sight, hearing, touch, and taste become sensors; a revving motor is a racing heart. All drones come standard with a rigger interface, but vehicles need them installed unless listed. Without the rigger interface, a rigger can control all vehicles from their captain’s chair, but they can’t really feel them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bikes Dodge Scoot It’s exactly what you would expect from some- thing called a Scoot. It’s compact, fuel-efficient, and super-affordable, not something for shadow- runners, unless they were trying to blend in or in- tentionally get attacked by a go-gang.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harley-Davidson Scorpion Big, bad, and built tough. The typical heavy-bod- ied, chromed road hog, with some armor and a whole lot of attitude. Usually seen on the streets under go-gangers, the Scorpion is still quite popu- lar with the regular population thanks to the repu- tation of Harley-Davidson.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yamaha Growler Popular with the thrill seeker, wilderness buff, and light-freight drug smuggler crowds, the best PR for the Growler came from its recent use by Sherman Kane on Blood Hunters.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suzuki Mirage Speed is the name of the game with the Mi- rage. A racing bike with a top end most never feel comfortable reaching, the Mirage is popular with go-gangers and other speed freaks.</p>

Though usually rolling through nothing more dangerous than a gated community, it is fully ca- pable of taking a run in the dirt or mud. Due to the size, amenities, and rich-neighborhood an- onymity, several security firms have been using these for a while, meaning several are available on the secondhand market if you don’t mind cleaning up some blood and patching a few bul- let holes.

With aquacologies and arkoblocks all over the plan- et, watercraft to access them are becoming more common. The Lamprey is a sea-sled designed for underwater inspection and transportation. It has enough space for four passengers who can have their own scuba gear or use systems built onto the sled, though that doubles the cost and provides a total of sixteen metahuman-hours of air. Military models of the Lamprey, dubbed the Sea Snake, are used for aquatic insertions by spec-ops forces like the UCAS Navy SEAL teams or British SAS. Each seating space can be substituted for a drone rack with a small drone, or two slots can be traded for a medium drone. Depths with individuals on board are limited to 100 meters, but drone-loaded mod- els can get down to 200 meters on a tether or with remote instructions. Wireless signals don’t reach those depths.</p>

With its shrouded electric motor, it makes practically no noise and has the same heat signature as a large hawk. In the country, it’s found on the backs of fun-loving sky-junkies. In more urban settings, you’ll see it on the backs of spec-ops forces gliding in undetected, and around the world it’s attached to smugglers with bundles of lightweight but valuable goods.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cessna C750 A twin-prop civilian aircraft designed for car- rying passengers and/or light cargo (legit or smug- gled). It can also be used for surveillance in a pinch. Affordable and easy to maintain, it’s a common sight at airfields around the world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">MCT-Sikorsky-Bell Seahawk Saved during the acquisition of Sikorsky-Bell by MCT, the Seahawk program was headed for the dumps after MCT’s troubles in the Algonkian-Mani- tou Council. The aircraft firm found the project, took it as theirs, and now offers a high-speed personal am- phibious jet, capable of hauling six passengers or a de- cent stack of cargo at high speeds. Great for restocking remote spots or ducking off into the middle of no- where to hide from the heat. This craft is amphibious and comes standard with buoyancy and flotation up- grades, meaning it can take off from land and water.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rotorcraft Thanks to their rotors, these craft can take off and land more or less straight up and down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ares Dragon By churning these out year after year for corps, nations, and individuals, Ares has made the Dragon the most commonly identifiable cargo helicopter in the world. The double-rotor design gives it the lifting capability to handle heavy cargo, Firewatch strike teams, or an ordnance load that would give its namesakes pause.</p>
<p class="calibre1">MCT-Sikorsky-Bell Wolfhound After a bad batch of rotor couplings put dozens of Nissan Hounds on the dirt permanently, MCT swooped in, stole the contract for the Imperial Jap- anese Marines, and has been creeping its newest rotorcraft into every market MCT touches&mdash;and since MCT is the top mega, that’s a lot of markets. Built for battle but sleek enough to make execs swoon, the Wolfhound is fast gaining a popular- ity similar to the Black Hawk at the turn of the century.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Northrup Wasp This single-seater is standard fare for police and security forces. A heavy weapon mount, some light armoring, and a whole lot of speed and maneuver- ability make this thing a bane of runners, especial- ly when flying in teams.</p>
<p class="calibre1">VTOL/VSTOL Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) and ver- tical/short take-off and landing craft use a basic fixed-wing structure, then tweak it to allow take- off and landing without too much runway space. VTOL, by definition, need no runway, while VSTOL often need a short ramp to help them launch.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ares Venture The Venture is a cheap and small LAV (low al- titude vehicle), but it makes up for those factors with popularity and customization options galore.</p>
<p class="calibre1">GEAR //</p>
<p class="calibre1">Used by security and military forces, as well as the smugglers they hunt, the Venture is a great sleeper LAV. You see its common shell and don’t realize what’s been added under the plain exterior. Thanks to some great marketing, the Venture sits atop the third-world LAV market.</p>
<p class="calibre1">GMC Banshee An icon of LAV design and a pinnacle of achievement for a smuggler’s garage. Primarily only found in the hands of high-budget militaries and corp security outfits, the Banshee zips along at supersonic speeds to make deliveries, recon runs, rapid assaults, troop drops, and a plethora of other badass maneuvers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Federated Boeing Commuter/Osprey X The design of this pair is reminiscent of the old C-130 Hercules/AC-130 Spectre concept, but run in reverse. Take something designed for one pur- pose and do a hell of a job refitting it for another. The Commuter is a dual-prop, tilt-wing passenger craft used to shuttle execs and corporate sarari- men. The Osprey X is the latest design of a bat- tle-tested VTOL/VSTOL rotorcraft used for trans- port, close air support, and recon. Fed-Boeing took an Osprey and dressed it up for officer transport, and the Commuter was born.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Microdrones Wheeled GMC Micromachine A very sophisticated children’s toy, with in- terchangeable bodies and oversized wheels for self-righting. Tiny, innocuous, and fun to race around a little track.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anthro Shiawase Kanmushi This four-legged crawler drone looks like a nor- mal insect at a glance. Great for penetrating se- cure facilities with its gecko-tipped extremities and light weight. It has the problem of decreased range to minimize transmissions but offsets that with a brighter than average Pilot system. Extremely frag- ile, a finger or the pulse of a tag eraser will easily render it inoperable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rotor Sikorsky-Bell Microskimmer XXS About the size and shape of a bottlecap, the Microskimmer flies via weak hoverjets. Its larger</p>
<p class="calibre1">cousins, the frisbee-sized miniskimmer and trash- can-lid-sized skimmer, have an interesting stacking feature that allow the three to be loaded into a single drone rack slot that holds the largest in the family.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Winged MCT Gnat Tiny and slow, but indistinguishable from an insect without a microscope or vision mag, the Gnat is often used in MCT’s Zero Zones, where a swarm of them all carry DMSO/Narcoject mini- slap patches on their feet, then land en masse on a target. They’re sold in packs of 10.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Minidrones Wheeled GM-Nissan Flip-Flop A tracked drone about the size of an RC car, the Flip-Flop’s tracks are larger than the body frame and the frame has a gyroscopic center that rolls to always be upright while the Flip-Flop can tum- ble and roll. Great for all-terrain environments, it can still get quite a bit of speed on a straight, flat stretch of land.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anthro Shiawase Inu A little four-legged friend that comes with a fur- ry suit to make it look and feel more like a real dog. Better suits can be bought (500¥) that make it actually look like a real dog, though its movements are still a bit robotic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rotor Horizon Flying Eye A spherical flying drone about the size of an eye- ball, it uses omnidirectional thrust nozzles to stay aloft but can also roll on the ground. Usually used for surveillance, a version with a built-in flash-pak or smoke grenade costs an extra 500¥. The flash- pak can be recharged as normal; the smoke gre- nade destroys the drone. The smoke grenade can be swapped with some other kind of grenade as well, obviously destroying the drone upon use.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Winged MCT Hornet Thanks to its slightly bulkier form, the Hornet, a kin of the venerable Fly-Spy, can achieve greater altitudes and serve as an eye in the sky for runners trying to keep their intentions low-key, but who also want the option to make someone’s life miser-</p>
<p class="calibre1">299</p>
<p class="calibre1">// GEAR</p>
<p class="calibre1">300</p>
<p class="calibre1">able. Usually framed like a tarantula hawk wasp, they carry an injector in the narrow abdomen with a single dose of something unpleasant (purchased separately).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Small Drones Wheeled Chrysler-Nissan Pursuit V This wheeled drone’s design principles were low, flat, and heavy, all to allow it to run at For- mula One speeds, meaning nothing can outrun it. Outdrive it, sure and outgun it, yup, but for pure speed, there is nothing with wheels that matches the Pursuit V.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anthro Aztechnology Crawler If you don’t have a fear of insects/spiders be- fore you see a Crawler, you will after. Designed for skittering up stairs, across floors, and through the underbrush, the Crawler is a half meter wide, multi-terrain drone with a hearty (and terrifying) design.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rotor Cyberspace Designs Quadrotor A small quadcopter designed for aerial surveil- lance and monitoring, it uses lightweight parts and a patented rotor design to get some of the highest altitude on the market. To keep the weight light, the only weapon mount it can take is an air-pow- ered crossbow. (Projectile, DV 3P, Attack Ratings 2/10/4/2/&mdash;)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Winged Lockheed Optic-X2 The size of a cyberdeck with its wings folded up for transport, it deploys to the size of a large hawk and launches with a simple arm toss, making it a VSTOL craft, but it can’t hover. Designed for sur- reptitious surveillance, it’s hard to track and spot, making it a favorite of shadowrunners and securi- ty firms. Design and paint increase the Perception threshold on the Optic-X2 by 1.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Medium Drones Wheeled GM-Nissan Doberman A tracked perimeter-patrol drone designed for day or night conditions with its solid sensor suite, it is useful but unsuited for stairs. They come with a standard weapon mount.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anthro Nissan Samurai/Oni Two legs are not better than four when talking drone design. The Nissan Shogun first took the niche fame of the Ares Duelist and made a design far superior, though still limited by its metahu- man-like frame, but the Samurai and Oni blended metahuman with…well, something else. The Sa- murai falls in the medium-size category, while the Oni is large. Both are specifically outfitted when ordered from Nissan with a quartet of retractable blades on the arms and heels, and each arm has a standard weapon mount. Each of the Samurai’s arms can fit something SMG size or smaller with fifty rounds of ammo; the Oni can hold a rifle and one hundred rounds in each arm. The big design advantage comes in terms of speed, but it sacrifices some combat ability. These designs can bend for four-limbed movement but lose access to all weap- ons while doing so.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rotor MCT-Nissan Roto-Drone MCT-Nissan got this right so long ago, they have never changed it much. It has a rotor top over a lower body designed for customization and easy repurpos- ing. A camera drone can be swapped into an assault drone in under one minute. Treat its Body as 3 high- er than its actual rating for determining how many weapon mounts or customizations it can integrate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Winged Federated Boeing Blackhawk It ain’t pretty, but it does its job well, and that job is removing other aerial threats from the area of operations. Popular with Desert Wars teams, the Blackhawk is an attack drone. The small profile limits speed but makes it a hard target to tag. They tend to fly in “packs,” orchestrating their fields of fire to leave no escape (count their number as 1.5 times larger for grunt group attacks, and players can use the grunt attack style described on p.&nbsp;114 against the threat).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Large Drones Wheeled Steel Lynx Combat Drone This is what people mean when they refer to a “killing machine.” The Steel Lynx is armed and armored to the teeth, rolling wheeled death across the field on four telescoping wheeled limbs al- lowing it to pop and shoot over cover. You gain a bonus Minor Action when using the Take Cover Minor Action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">GEAR //</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anthro Ares Packmule Jokingly referred to as the “Hauling Ass,” the Packmule is a four-legged cargo hauler intended for rough terrain where roads are rare and air- space is dangerous. Spec-ops teams will often ditch a centerline of pack boxes for a gyro arm under an HMG used as a turret by the team’s support specialist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rotor Cyberspace Designs Dalmatian Able to be folded down to lawn-mower size, this VTOL recon drone is easy to haul behind enemy</p>
<p class="calibre1">lines. It deploys to hang-glider size and is frequent- ly spotted over urban and rural locations that have contracts with Lone Star or Knight Errant, as they use them for patrol and surveillance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Winged Ares Black Sky A black project for the longest time, the Black Sky moved toward full production after field tests during the Boston lockdown were a stellar success. This drone is Ares’ latest in stealth air-to-ground support. Able to drop supplies or rain down hell with minimal chance for detection, the Black Sky will definitely be finding its way into the regular rotation for runners and smugglers alike.</p>
